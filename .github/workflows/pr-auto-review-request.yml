name: Auto Request Code Review

# Automatically request reviews from @codex and @gemini-code-assist when PRs are opened
# This ensures we never forget to request automated code reviews
# See: docs/STANDARDS/GIT_WORKFLOW.md for review policy
#
# IMPORTANT: This workflow uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) to authenticate as your user account
# instead of github-actions[bot]. This makes comments/commits appear under your username.
#
# Setup required (one-time):
# 1. Create a fine-grained PAT at: https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
#    - Repository access: Select this repository only
#    - Permissions: "Pull requests" → Read and write, "Contents" → Read
#    - Expiration: 90 days (set calendar reminder to rotate)
#
# 2. Store the PAT as a repository secret:
#    - Go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
#    - Name: USER_PR_TOKEN
#    - Value: <paste your PAT>
#
# 3. Security: Never commit the PAT directly. Rotate every 90 days.
