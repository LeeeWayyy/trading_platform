  "status": "complete",
  "plan_summary": "The T2.8 implementation plan is comprehensive and strictly adheres to the P4T2 task specifications. It correctly identifies all key components: DuckDB registry, immutable versioning, artifact serialization with checksums, and deep integration with P4T1 DatasetVersionManager for PIT safety. The plan includes the required 'DiskExpressionCache' with the specific 5-component key format for PIT correctness. It also correctly handles the Qlib optionality by making relevant metadata fields nullable. The proposed implementation order is logical, starting with core data models and serialization before moving to the API and CLI layers. The validation gates (IC/Sharpe thresholds, paper trading) and backup strategies are well-defined.",
  "approved": true,
  "review_notes": [
    "Plan covers all acceptance criteria including the DiskExpressionCache and Qlib optionality.",
    "Data models correctly include 'snapshot_id' and 'config_hash' for PIT safety.",
    "Promotion gates and version compatibility checks are well-defined.",
    "The 6-phase implementation strategy is logical and minimizes dependency risks."
