## Migration Notes

**Migrated:** {date.today().isoformat()}
**Original File:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/{old_file.name}`
**Migration:** Automated migration to task lifecycle system

**Historical Context:**
This task was completed before the PxTy_TASK ‚Üí _PROGRESS ‚Üí _DONE lifecycle
system was introduced. The content above represents the implementation guide
that was created during development.

For new tasks, use the structured DONE template with:
- Summary of what was built
- Code references
- Test coverage details
- Zen-MCP review history
- Lessons learned
- Metrics

See `docs/TASKS/00-TEMPLATE_DONE.md` for the current standard format.
