"""
Integration tests for kill-switch critical fixes.

This test suite verifies fixes for 3 critical issues identified by Codex review:
- Fix #1: Redis list operations (tested in test_redis_client.py)
- Fix #2: Fail-closed behavior when Redis unavailable (CRITICAL)
- Fix #3: JSON body handling for kill-switch endpoints (HIGH)

Context:
    These tests were created in response to post-commit review findings
    where kill-switch implementation had blocking safety issues.
