# Assistant Rules (Load this into your AI tool)
- Follow /docs/REPO_MAP.md for where code lives.
- Adhere to OpenAPI contracts; do not change without PR + ADR.
- Do not create new services; extend existing ones.
- Prefer small, isolated commits per ticket.
- Always write/adjust tests first; do not disable tests to pass CI.
- Keep logs structured; never log secrets.
