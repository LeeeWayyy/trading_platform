# Deep Zen-MCP Review Workflow

**Purpose:** Comprehensive review of all branch changes before creating pull request (MANDATORY quality gate)
**Prerequisites:** Feature complete, all progressive commits done, local tests passing
**Expected Outcome:** Branch validated for architecture, testing, edge cases; ready for PR creation
**Owner:** @development-team + zen-mcp maintainers
**Last Reviewed:** 2025-10-21

---

## When to Use This Workflow

**MANDATORY before creating ANY pull request:**
- ✅ After completing all progressive commits for a feature
- ✅ Before running `gh pr create`
- ✅ After all tests pass locally
- ✅ When feature/fix is ready for team review

**This is different from quick review:**
- **Quick review (03):** Individual commits, ~30 seconds, safety focus
- **Deep review (04):** All branch changes, ~3-5 minutes, comprehensive analysis

**Even if all quick reviews passed:**
- Integration issues between commits
- Architecture patterns across changes
- Test coverage completeness
- Edge cases in combined logic
- Documentation quality

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Verify Feature Completion

**Check that feature is actually complete:**
- [ ] All requirements from ticket implemented
- [ ] All progressive commits completed
- [ ] All quick zen reviews passed
- [ ] Local tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

**If incomplete:**
- Finish implementation first
- OR create as draft PR
- Don't request deep review for WIP

### 2. Review Your Branch Changes

```bash
# See all commits in your branch
git log master..HEAD --oneline

# See all file changes
git diff master..HEAD --stat

# Review actual changes
git diff master..HEAD
```

**What this does:** Gives you context on what zen will review

**Quick self-check:**
- Are there obvious issues?
- Did you forget to commit something?
- Are there debug/temp files?
- Does the diff make sense?

### 3. Ensure Clean Working Tree

```bash
git status
```

**Expected:** "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

**If uncommitted changes:**
```bash
# Commit them first using progressive commit workflow
# See 01-git-commit.md
```

### 4. Run Full Test Suite

```bash
make test
make lint
```

**Expected:** ✅ All tests pass, no lint errors

**If failures:**
- Fix issues first
- Don't request deep review until green
- Deep review assumes tests pass

### 5. Request Deep Zen Review

**Option A: Use slash command (recommended)**
```
/zen-review deep
```

**Option B: Tell Claude directly**
```
"Deep review all branch changes with zen-mcp"
```

**Option C: Specify comparison explicitly**
```
"Deep review changes from master to current branch with zen-mcp"
```

**What happens:**
- Claude Code triggers zen-mcp (Codex) with comprehensive mode
- Zen analyzes ALL changes since branching from master
- Includes code, tests, docs, configs
- Review takes ~3-5 minutes
- Results returned with detailed findings

### 6. Review Comprehensive Findings

**Zen-mcp deep review covers:**

**1. Architecture & Design:**
- Overall design patterns
- Service boundaries
- Code organization
- Coupling and cohesion

**2. Code Quality:**
- Type safety
- Error handling completeness
- Logging sufficiency
- Code duplication

**3. Trading Safety:**
- Circuit breaker integration
- Idempotency patterns
- Position limit logic
- Risk check completeness

**4. Testing:**
- Unit test coverage
- Integration test coverage
- Edge cases covered
- Test quality (mocking, assertions)

**5. Documentation:**
- Docstrings complete
- ADR if needed
- Concept docs if needed
- Implementation guide updates

**6. Integration Points:**
- API contract compatibility
- Database schema changes
- Service dependencies
- External API usage

**Example deep review output:**

## Decision Points

### Should I defer MEDIUM issues?

**Fix immediately if:**
- Quick to fix (<30 min total)
- Safety-related
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation is incomplete

**Can defer if:**
- Requires separate investigation
- Out of scope for this PR
- User explicitly approves
- Created follow-up task

**Document deferral:**
```markdown
## Deferred Issues from Zen Deep Review

1. **MEDIUM:** Performance optimization for position queries
   - Reason: Requires profiling and index analysis
   - Follow-up: Created ticket P1.5T3
   - User approved: @username
```

### Deep review taking too long?

**Normal:** 3-5 minutes
**Acceptable:** Up to 10 minutes (complex changes)
**Too long:** > 15 minutes

**If taking > 15 minutes:**
- Large PR (maybe split into smaller PRs)
- Network issues
- Zen server overloaded
- Try again later

### Zen found many issues - should I fix all?

**Yes for HIGH/CRITICAL**
- Non-negotiable
- PR blocked until fixed

**Fix MEDIUM if reasonable**
- Most MEDIUM issues should be fixed
- Total fix time should be < 1 hour
- If > 1 hour, discuss scope with user

**Document LOW issues**
- Create follow-up tasks
- Note in PR for future cleanup
- Don't block PR

### Should I split this into multiple PRs?

**Consider splitting if:**
- Zen review finds > 10 issues
- Changes span multiple unrelated features
- Some changes are controversial
- PR diff > 1000 lines

**Benefits of splitting:**
- Easier to review
- Faster to merge
- Lower risk
- Clearer history

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Deep Review Finds Issues Quick Reviews Missed

**Symptom:** Quick reviews passed, but deep review finds problems

**This is normal!** Deep review has broader context:
- Integration between commits
- Cross-file patterns
- Overall architecture
- Test coverage across feature
- Documentation completeness

**Solution:**
- Fix the issues found
- Learn patterns for next feature
- Quick reviews catch most issues (70-80%)
- Deep review catches integration issues (20-30%)

### Issue: Unclear If Issue Applies to My Changes

**Symptom:** Zen flags something in code you didn't modify

**Solution:**
```
"Zen flagged issue in file X, but I didn't modify that file.
Is this a pre-existing issue or related to my changes?"

Zen will clarify:
- "This is pre-existing, safe to ignore for this PR"
- OR "Your changes interact with this code, please review"
```

**For pre-existing issues:**
- Note in PR: "Found pre-existing issue in X, created ticket Y"
- Don't fix in current PR (scope creep)
- Create follow-up task

### Issue: Can't Reproduce Issue Zen Found

**Symptom:** Zen reports bug, but tests pass

**Solution:**
```
"Zen reported issue with [X], but tests pass.
Can you provide a concrete example or test case that demonstrates the problem?"

Zen will provide:
- Specific scenario that triggers issue
- Test case to reproduce
- OR clarify it's potential issue, not current bug
```

### Issue: Disagree With Architecture Suggestion

**Symptom:** Zen suggests architecture change you don't agree with

**Solution:**
```
"Zen suggested [architecture change], but I think current approach is better because [reasons].
Can we discuss this?"
```

**Then involve user:**
```
User: "What did zen suggest?"
Claude: "Zen suggests [X] to improve [Y], but current approach does [Z]. What's your preference?"
User decides: Keep current OR Make change
```

**Architecture is collaborative!** Zen provides suggestions, user/team decides.

### Issue: Too Many Issues to Fix Now

**Symptom:** Deep review found 15+ issues

**This suggests:**
- PR is too large (split it)
- Skipped progressive reviews (go back to 30-60 min cadence)
- Foundational issues (might need architectural discussion)

**Solution:**
1. Discuss with user: "Zen found 15 issues. Should we:"
   - Fix all now (might take 2-3 hours)
   - Split into multiple smaller PRs
   - Defer some MEDIUM/LOW issues
   - Revisit architecture

2. Most common: Split into smaller PRs
   - Part 1: Core functionality (5 issues to fix)
   - Part 2: Additional features (10 issues to fix later)

## Examples

### Example 1: Clean Deep Review

```bash
# Feature complete with 4 progressive commits

$ git status
On branch feature/position-limits
nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ make test && make lint
===================== 58 passed in 2.82s ======================
✅ All checks passed

$ "Deep review all branch changes with zen-mcp"

# (3 minutes later)

Zen: "🔍 Deep Review Complete

✅ APPROVED - Excellent implementation

Summary:
- 4 commits, 287 lines changed
- 0 HIGH, 0 MEDIUM, 2 LOW issues
- Test coverage: 97% (target: 80%) ✅
- Documentation: Complete ✅
- Architecture: Clean, follows patterns ✅

LOW suggestions:
1. Consider extracting validation logic to separate class (future refactor)
2. Add performance benchmark for limit checks (nice-to-have)

Ready for PR creation!
Continuation ID: deep-abc123"

$ # Proceed to create PR with zen summary
$ gh pr create
# (Include zen review summary)
```

### Example 2: Issues Found and Fixed

```bash
$ "Deep review all branch changes with zen-mcp"

# (4 minutes later)

Zen: "🔍 Deep Review Complete

⚠️ 3 MEDIUM issues to address before PR

1. MEDIUM: Missing test for edge case (position at exactly limit)
2. MEDIUM: Incomplete error handling in concurrent scenario
3. MEDIUM: Concept doc has TODO sections

Estimated fix time: 30-45 minutes
Continuation ID: deep-abc123"

# Fix all 3 issues (35 minutes)
# Add edge case test
# Improve error handling
# Complete documentation

$ git add tests/ apps/ docs/
$ git commit -m "Address deep review findings

- Add test for position-at-limit edge case
- Handle concurrent position updates with locks
- Complete risk management concept doc

Zen deep review: 3 MEDIUM issues fixed"

$ "I've fixed all 3 issues, please verify"

Zen: "✅ Verification complete (continuation: deep-abc123)

1. Edge case test: ✅ Added, covers scenario
2. Concurrent handling: ✅ Fixed with proper locking
3. Documentation: ✅ All TODOs completed

All issues resolved. Ready for PR!
Continuation ID: deep-abc123"

$ gh pr create
# (Include zen review + fix summary)
```

### Example 3: Deferring Some Issues

```bash
$ "Deep review all branch changes with zen-mcp"

Zen: "⚠️ 1 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM issues

HIGH:
1. Circuit breaker check missing in rollback path

MEDIUM:
2. Performance: N+1 query in position loading
3. Missing logging in error scenarios
4. Concept doc could be more detailed

Fix HIGH immediately. MEDIUM require discussion.
Continuation ID: deep-abc123"

# Fix HIGH immediately
$ git add apps/execution_gateway/rollback.py
$ git commit -m "Add circuit breaker check to rollback path"

$ "User: Zen found 3 MEDIUM issues. The HIGH is fixed.
Can I defer the performance and logging issues to follow-up tickets?
They're improvements but not blockers."

User: "Fix the logging (quick), defer performance (needs analysis)"

# Fix logging (10 minutes)
$ git add apps/execution_gateway/
$ git commit -m "Add error logging per zen review"

$ "Zen: I fixed the HIGH (circuit breaker) and MEDIUM (logging).
Deferring performance optimization to ticket P1.5T3.
User approved deferral. Please verify fixes."

Zen: "✅ Verification complete

1. Circuit breaker: ✅ Fixed correctly
2. Logging: ✅ Added with proper context
3. Performance: Deferred (user approved)
4. Concept doc: Enhanced based on feedback

Ready for PR with deferred issue documented.
Continuation ID: deep-abc123"

$ gh pr create
# (Include zen summary + document deferred performance issue)
```
