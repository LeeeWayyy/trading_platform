## 📝 Creating New Workflows

1. Copy [00-template.md](./00-template.md)
2. Choose appropriate number (see numbering scheme below)
3. Follow template structure exactly
4. Add entry to this README
5. Link from relevant docs (CLAUDE.md, standards, etc.)
6. Request review before committing

### Numbering Scheme

- **01-09:** Core development lifecycle (git, reviews, testing, docs)
- **10-19:** Operations and infrastructure (CI, deployment, monitoring)
- **20-29:** Advanced workflows (performance, security, scaling)
- **30-39:** Team collaboration (onboarding, knowledge transfer)
- **90-99:** Emergency procedures (hotfix, incident response, rollback)

**When to renumber:**
- Insert workflow between existing numbers: Add +1 to all following workflows
- Document renumbering in git commit message
- Update all references in docs

---

## ✅ Workflow Quality Standards

All workflows must:
- [ ] Follow the template structure in [00-template.md](./00-template.md)
- [ ] Include clear prerequisites and expected outcomes
- [ ] Provide concrete examples (not just theory)
- [ ] Link to relevant standards and ADRs
- [ ] List related workflows for navigation
- [ ] Include troubleshooting section
- [ ] Specify owner and last review date
- [ ] Keep steps ≤10 for clarity (split if longer)
- [ ] Use consistent terminology with project glossary

## 🆘 Getting Help

**Can't find the workflow you need?**
1. Check [docs/INDEX.md](../../docs/INDEX.md) for related documentation
2. Search existing workflows for similar tasks
3. Ask in team chat or create an issue
4. Create new workflow using template

**Workflow seems outdated?**
1. Check "Last Reviewed" date in workflow header
2. Test the workflow and document issues
3. Update workflow and increment review date
4. Create PR with changes

**Workflow conflicts with standards?**
1. Standards documents in `/docs/STANDARDS/` take precedence
2. Update workflow to match standards
3. If standards need updating, create ADR first
