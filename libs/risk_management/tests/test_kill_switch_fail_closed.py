"""
Tests for kill-switch fail-closed behavior.

This test suite verifies that kill-switch NEVER auto-resumes trading when
Redis state is missing. This is a critical safety property: if Redis is
flushed/restarted while kill-switch is ENGAGED, the system must remain
closed (blocked) until an operator explicitly verifies safety.

Context:
    P0 issue identified in PR review: get_status() was silently reinitializing
    to ACTIVE when Redis state was missing, potentially resuming trading after
    a Redis flush while the system was halted.

Fix:
    Both get_state() and get_status() now raise RuntimeError when state is
    missing (fail-closed). Status queries NEVER mutate state.

Testing Strategy:
    - Unit tests verify RuntimeError is raised when state missing
    - Verify error messages are clear and actionable
    - Verify no auto-reinitialization occurs
    - Test both get_state() and get_status() methods
