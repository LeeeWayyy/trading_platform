# P1T13 Phase 2: Workflow Simplification Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** Analysis Complete (UPDATED) - Ready for Dual Review

---

> Note: The repository's AI workflow state has been migrated in code to use `.ai_workflow/` (workflow-state.json). Many older docs and scripts still reference the legacy `.claude/` directory; both are supported for now but prefer `.ai_workflow/` in new tooling. See scripts/ai_workflow/constants.py for details.

## Executive Summary

Analyzed 13 of 20 workflow files (8,854 total lines). Identified significant redundancy patterns across workflow documentation that can be consolidated without information loss.

**Current Metrics:**
- 20 workflow files
- 8,854 total lines
- ~442 lines average per file
- Estimated redundancy: 40-50%

**Target Metrics:**
- Same 20 workflow files
- ~4,400-5,300 total lines (50% reduction)
- ~220-265 lines average per file
- Zero information loss
