# Git Workflow & Pull Request Automation

## Overview

This document explains how to work with Git and automate pull request creation when using Claude Code or other AI assistants.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install GitHub CLI

```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux
# See https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md

# Windows
# See https://github.com/cli/cli#windows
```

### 2. Authenticate GitHub CLI

```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Select:
# - GitHub.com
# - HTTPS
# - Login with a web browser (recommended)
# - Follow the prompts

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

### 3. Configure Git

```bash
# Set your identity (if not already done)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Recommended: Set default branch name
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Recommended: Enable commit signing (optional but good practice)
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

## Feature Development Workflow

### Two Development Modes

**Mode 1: Direct to Master (Small Fixes)**
- For trivial changes, documentation updates, or hotfixes
- Commit directly to master with comprehensive commit message
- Example: T1 implementation (complete feature with all tests passing)

**Mode 2: Feature Branch with Incremental Commits (Recommended for Tx Tickets)**
- Create feature branch (e.g., `feature/t2-alpaca-connector`)
- Make incremental commits as you build the feature
- Create PR when ticket goal is complete
- Allows for regular backups and progress tracking

### Feature Branch Development Process

When implementing a Tx ticket (T2, T3, T4, etc.):

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/t2-alpaca-connector
   ```

2. **Make Incremental Commits**
   - Commit small, logical units of work frequently
   - Each commit should compile/pass basic checks
   - Commit messages can be concise during development

   ```bash
   # Example incremental commits during T2 development:
   git commit -m "Add Alpaca API client wrapper"
   git commit -m "Implement historical data fetching"
   git commit -m "Add rate limiting logic"
   git commit -m "Implement corporate actions fetching"
   git commit -m "Add unit tests for API client"
   git commit -m "Add integration tests"
   git commit -m "Update documentation"
   ```

3. **Push Regularly (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Push to backup your work and track progress
   git push -u origin feature/t2-alpaca-connector
   ```

4. **When Ticket Goal Complete**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Ensure documentation is updated
   - Create PR for review and merge

### Progressive Committing Philosophy

**REQUIRED: Commit Early, Commit Often**

When working on any non-trivial feature, you MUST use progressive commits throughout development. Do NOT wait until everything is complete to make your first commit.

**Why Incremental Commits During Feature Development?**

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Regular backups of work in progress
- ‚úÖ Easier to revert specific changes if needed
- ‚úÖ Better tracking of development progress
- ‚úÖ Clearer history of how feature was built
- ‚úÖ Can resume work after interruptions
- ‚úÖ Enables collaboration and review at each stage
- ‚úÖ Makes debugging easier (bisect to find regressions)

**When to Commit (Progressive Strategy):**
- After implementing a logical component (even if incomplete)
- After tests pass for that component
- Before taking a break or ending session
- Before attempting risky refactoring
- **At minimum: every 30-60 minutes of active development**
- After fixing a bug or addressing review feedback
- When switching between different parts of the feature

**Example Progressive Commit Sequence:**
```bash
# Session 1: Initial setup (30 min)
git commit -m "Add Alpaca API client skeleton"

# Session 2: Core functionality (1 hour)
git commit -m "Implement authentication and connection"
git commit -m "Add historical data fetching method"

# Session 3: Error handling (45 min)
git commit -m "Add rate limiting with exponential backoff"
git commit -m "Handle API errors with retry logic"

# Session 4: Testing (1 hour)
git commit -m "Add unit tests for API client"
git commit -m "Add integration tests with mock server"

# Session 5: Documentation (30 min)
git commit -m "Add docstrings and update implementation guide"
```

**Anti-Pattern to Avoid:**
```bash
# ‚ùå BAD - Single massive commit after 8 hours of work
git commit -m "Implement entire Alpaca connector (2000 lines changed)"
```

## Automated PR Workflow with Claude Code

### Workflow Overview

When you ask Claude Code to implement a feature, it can automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Create a feature branch
2. ‚úÖ Make code changes with incremental commits
3. ‚úÖ Write tests
4. ‚úÖ Run tests and linting
5. ‚úÖ Commit changes with descriptive messages
6. ‚úÖ Push to remote repository regularly
7. ‚úÖ Create pull request when feature complete
8. ‚úÖ Link related ADRs and documentation

### How to Enable Automatic PR Creation

**Option 1: Explicit Request (Recommended for Learning)**
```
User: "Implement idempotent order submission (ticket T4),
       then create a PR when done"
```

**Option 2: Default Behavior (Configure in Prompts)**

Add to your `prompts/assistant_rules.md`:
```markdown
## Automatic Pull Request Creation

After successfully implementing and testing any feature:
1. Create a feature branch (if not already on one)
2. Commit all changes with descriptive messages
3. Push to remote repository
4. Create a pull request using `gh pr create`
5. Include in PR description:
   - Summary of changes
   - Related ADR references
   - Testing completed
   - Checklist from /docs/STANDARDS/TESTING.md
```

**Option 3: Use a Slash Command**

Create `.claude/commands/implement-and-pr.md`:
```markdown
You are implementing a ticket and creating a PR afterwards.

Workflow:
1. Ask user which ticket to implement
2. Read ticket from /docs/TASKS/
3. Follow implementation process from CLAUDE.md
4. After validation phase passes:
   a. Create feature branch if not exists
   b. Commit all changes
   c. Push to remote
   d. Create PR with gh pr create
5. Return PR URL to user
```

Then use: `/implement-and-pr`

## PR Creation Template

When Claude creates a PR, it should use this structure:

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of what was implemented (1-2 sentences).

## Related Work
- Ticket: #T4 (or link to /docs/TASKS/P0_TICKETS.md#t4)

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

## Example Commands Claude Will Use

### Creating a Feature Branch
```bash
# Claude will run:
git checkout -b feature/t4-idempotent-orders
```

### Committing Changes
```bash
# If ADR exists, commit it first
git add docs/ADRs/0004-idempotent-order-submission.md
git commit -m "ADR-0004: Use deterministic client_order_id for idempotency"

# Then commit implementation
git add apps/execution_gateway/
git add tests/
git commit -m "Implement idempotent order submission (ADR-0004)

- Add deterministic_id() function using SHA256
- Update place_order() to check for duplicates
- Handle Alpaca 409 conflicts
- Add comprehensive tests

Closes #T4"
```

### Pushing and Creating PR
```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin feature/t4-idempotent-orders

# Create PR with gh CLI
gh pr create \
  --title "Implement idempotent order submission (T4)" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Implements idempotent order submission using deterministic client_order_id generation.

## Related Work
- Ticket: T4 (/docs/TASKS/P0_TICKETS.md)
- ADR: ADR-0004

## Changes Made
...
EOF
)"
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

Use consistent branch naming:

```bash
feature/t4-idempotent-orders     # New features
fix/circuit-breaker-recovery     # Bug fixes
docs/update-testing-guide        # Documentation only
refactor/extract-risk-checks     # Refactoring
chore/upgrade-dependencies       # Maintenance
```

## Controlling PR Creation

### When You Want Automatic PRs

Tell Claude:
```
"Implement ticket T4 and create a PR when tests pass"
```

### When You Want Manual Control

Tell Claude:
```
"Implement ticket T4 but don't create a PR yet -
 I want to review the changes first"
```

Then later:
```
"Create a PR for the changes we just made"
```

## PR Creation Safety Checks

Before Claude creates a PR, it should verify:

1. ‚úÖ All tests pass (`make test`)
2. ‚úÖ All linting passes (`make lint`)
3. ‚úÖ On a feature branch (not main/master)
4. ‚úÖ Changes are committed
5. ‚úÖ ADR created if needed
6. ‚úÖ Documentation updated

Claude will **not** automatically:
- ‚ùå Push to main/master directly
- ‚ùå Force push (unless explicitly requested and justified)
- ‚ùå Merge PRs without explicit reviewer approval (see "CRITICAL: Review Feedback and Merge Policy" above)
- ‚ùå Delete branches
- ‚ùå Modify git history with rebase/amend (unless explicitly requested)

## Working with Draft PRs

For work-in-progress, create draft PRs:

```bash
gh pr create --draft \
  --title "[WIP] Implement idempotent orders (T4)" \
  --body "Work in progress. Do not merge yet.

## TODO
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Get ADR reviewed
"
```

Then convert to ready when done:
```bash
gh pr ready
```

## Updating Existing PRs

Claude can update PRs by adding commits:

```bash
# Make additional changes
git add apps/execution_gateway/
git commit -m "Address review feedback: improve error messages"
git push

# Add comment to PR notifying automated reviewers
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "Updated to address review feedback.

@codex @gemini-code-assist please review the latest changes on this branch."
```

### IMPORTANT: Automated Code Review Requirement

**‚ú® NEW: Automatic Review Requests (2025-10-19)**

Review requests are now **automated via GitHub Actions**! When you create or reopen a PR, the workflow automatically:
- Posts a comment mentioning `@codex` and `@gemini-code-assist`
- Requests comprehensive code review (quality, security, testing, documentation)
- References this document for review policy

**See:** `.github/workflows/pr-auto-review-request.yml`

**What this means for you:**
- ‚úÖ No need to manually request reviews on PR creation
- ‚úÖ Consistent review requests across all PRs
- ‚úÖ Never forget to request automated reviews
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Still need to manually request re-review after fixing issues

**Manual re-review after fixes:**

After addressing review feedback and pushing new commits, you **MUST manually request re-review**:

```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "Fixed the issues you identified.

@codex @gemini-code-assist please review the latest changes on this branch."
```

**WAIT for reviewers to respond and confirm no issues before merging.**

This ensures multiple automated code reviewers catch issues before human review, providing diverse perspectives on code quality, security, and best practices.

**Additional Automation:**

- **Gemini Code Assist**: Configured via `.gemini/config.yaml` and `GEMINI.md`
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: `.github/workflows/ci-tests-coverage.yml` runs tests and coverage automatically
- **Codex CLI** (MANDATORY): See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/codex-mcp-integration.md` for local review setup

### CRITICAL: Review Feedback and Merge Policy

**ALL review feedback MUST be addressed before merging. You are NOT allowed to merge unless:**

1. **All High Priority Issues**: MUST be considered and fixed immediately if the issue is confirmed to exist, with test cases created to cover the fix if necessary
2. **All Medium Priority Issues**: MUST be considered and fixed immediately if the issue is confirmed to exist, with test cases created to cover the fix if necessary
3. **All Low Priority Issues**: MUST be considered and fixed immediately if the issue is confirmed to exist, with test cases created to cover the fix if necessary
4. **Only Exception**: Owner explicitly says you can defer specific issues to future work

**After fixing review feedback:**
- Push fixes and request re-review from `@codex` and `@gemini-code-assist`, asking them to check out the latest commit to avoid caching issues.
- **WAIT for reviewers to explicitly confirm "no issues" or approve the PR**
- Do NOT assume fixes are sufficient - reviewers must explicitly approve

**You are ONLY allowed to merge when:**
- ‚úÖ All reviewers explicitly say "no issues" or approve the PR
- ‚úÖ All review comments have been addressed or explicitly deferred by owner
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚ùå **NEVER** merge without explicit reviewer approval

**If you are unsure about deferring an issue:**
- Ask the owner: "Reviewer X raised issue Y. Should I fix it now or defer to future work?"
- Wait for owner's explicit approval before deferring
- Document deferred issues in the PR description or create follow-up tickets

### Handling Conflicting Reviewer Feedback

**Problem: Review Deadlocks**

Sometimes reviewers may provide conflicting feedback that creates a loop:
1. Gemini suggests adding feature X
2. You implement feature X
3. Codex says feature X causes regression issues
4. You remove feature X
5. Gemini complains feature X is missing again
6. **Review deadlock** - cannot satisfy both reviewers

**Resolution Strategy: Codex as Tie-Breaker**

When conflicting feedback creates a review loop on a **specific change**:

1. **Identify the Conflict**: Recognize when two reviewers disagree on the same specific implementation detail
2. **Use Codex as Golden Standard**: If Codex approves the implementation, defer Gemini's conflicting suggestion
3. **Document the Decision**: Add a comment explaining why Gemini's suggestion was not implemented
4. **Scope is Limited**: This only applies to the specific conflicting change, NOT all of Gemini's feedback

**Example Scenario:**

```bash
# Round 1: Gemini review
Gemini: "Add error handling for network timeouts in fetch_positions()"

# Round 2: You implement
git commit -m "Add network timeout handling to fetch_positions()"

# Round 3: Codex review
Codex: "The timeout handling in fetch_positions() will cause regression -
        it prevents graceful degradation when Execution Gateway is temporarily down.
        The existing error handling is correct."

# Round 4: You revert
git revert <commit-hash>
git commit -m "Revert timeout handling - causes regression per Codex review"

# Round 5: Gemini review
Gemini: "Still missing timeout handling in fetch_positions()"

# RESOLUTION: Break the loop
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "@codex confirmed the existing error
handling is correct and adding timeout handling would cause regression.
Deferring Gemini's suggestion on this specific change.

@codex please confirm this implementation is still acceptable."
```

**When to Apply This Rule:**

‚úÖ **Apply tie-breaker when:**
- Same specific change reviewed multiple times
- Clear conflict between reviewer suggestions (not just different perspectives)
- Codex explicitly says implementation is correct
- Loop has occurred 2+ times on same issue
- Regression or correctness is at stake

‚ùå **Do NOT apply tie-breaker when:**
- Reviewers comment on different parts of the code
- Suggestions are complementary (can implement both)
- Only 1 round of feedback (not yet a loop)
- Owner has not explicitly approved using tie-breaker
- Issue is about code style (not correctness)

**Proper Documentation:**

When using Codex as tie-breaker, document clearly:

```bash
# In PR comment:
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "## Conflicting Reviewer Feedback Resolution

**Issue:** Gemini suggests adding timeout handling, Codex says it causes regression

**Attempts:**
1. Implemented Gemini's suggestion (commit abc123)
2. Codex identified regression risk
3. Reverted (commit def456)
4. Gemini re-requested same change

**Resolution:** Using Codex as tie-breaker per GIT_WORKFLOW.md
- Codex confirmed existing implementation is correct
- Timeout handling would prevent graceful degradation
- Keeping current implementation

**Scope:** This decision applies ONLY to timeout handling in fetch_positions()
- All other Gemini feedback is still being addressed
- Not deferring any other suggestions

@codex please confirm this is still acceptable"
```

**Important Notes:**

1. **Limited Scope**: Tie-breaker only applies to the specific conflicting change
2. **All Other Feedback Remains**: Continue addressing all non-conflicting feedback
3. **Owner Awareness**: If uncertain, ask owner before using tie-breaker
4. **Final Approval Still Required**: Codex must still explicitly approve the PR
5. **Document Everything**: Clear audit trail of decision process

## Best Practices

### 1. One Feature Per PR
Keep PRs focused:
- ‚úÖ Single ticket implementation
- ‚úÖ Related tests and docs
- ‚ùå Multiple unrelated changes
- ‚ùå Mixing features and refactoring

### 2. Meaningful Commit Messages

**For Final PR Commits (Mode 1: Direct to Master):**
```bash
# GOOD - Comprehensive with details
"Implement deterministic order ID generation (ADR-0004)

- Add SHA256-based hash function
- Include order params and date in hash
- Truncate to 24 chars for Alpaca compatibility
- Add unit tests for collision resistance"

# BAD
"Fixed stuff"
"Updates"
```

**For Incremental Commits (Mode 2: Feature Branch Development):**
```bash
# GOOD - Concise but clear
"Add Alpaca API client wrapper"
"Implement rate limiting with exponential backoff"
"Add unit tests for historical data fetching"
"Fix type hints in corporate actions module"

# ACCEPTABLE during development
"WIP: Adding authentication logic"
"Draft: Initial market data connector structure"

# STILL BAD - Too vague
"Fixed stuff"
"Updates"
"Changes"
```

**Note:** Incremental commits can be more concise since the PR description will provide comprehensive context. The key is that each commit represents a logical unit of work.

### 3. Keep PRs Small
Aim for:
- < 500 lines of code changes
- < 10 files changed
- Single focused change

Large changes should be split into multiple PRs:
```
PR #1: Add deterministic ID generation (ADR-0004)
PR #2: Integrate ID generation into order submission
PR #3: Add duplicate detection logic
PR #4: Add integration tests
```

### 4. Link Everything
In PR description, link to:
- Ticket in /docs/TASKS/
- ADR in /docs/ADRs/
- Implementation guide
- Related concept docs
- Related PRs (if any)

### 5. Use PR Templates (Optional)

Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
```markdown
## Summary
<!-- Brief description of changes -->

## Related Work
- Ticket:
- ADR:
- Implementation Guide:

## Changes Made
- [ ]

## Testing Completed
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing in DRY_RUN mode

## Documentation Updated
- [ ] Concept docs
- [ ] Implementation guide
- [ ] ADR (if architectural change)
- [ ] Code has docstrings
- [ ] OpenAPI spec (if API changed)

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] OpenAPI updated (if API changed)
- [ ] Migrations included (if DB changed)
- [ ] Docs updated

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `gh` command not found
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh  # macOS
# or follow instructions at https://cli.github.com/
```

### Issue: Authentication failed
```bash
# Re-authenticate
gh auth login

# Check status
gh auth status
```

### Issue: Permission denied
```bash
# Check remote URL uses HTTPS (not SSH if not configured)
git remote -v

# Update to HTTPS if needed
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### Issue: Branch protection rules
If main/master has branch protection:
- PRs are required (good!)
- Claude cannot push directly (good!)
- You'll need to review and merge via GitHub UI

### Issue: PR created on wrong branch
```bash
# Close the PR
gh pr close <PR_NUMBER>

# Create correct branch
git checkout -b correct-branch-name

# Cherry-pick commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Push and create new PR
git push -u origin correct-branch-name
gh pr create
```

## Automated Code Review & CI/CD Integration

### Overview of Automation

This project uses multiple layers of automated code quality checks:

1. **Automatic Review Requests** (GitHub Actions)
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** (Tests + Coverage)
3. **Gemini Code Assist** (AI-powered code review)
4. **Codex CLI** (Optional local review)

### 1. Automatic Review Requests

**File:** `.github/workflows/pr-auto-review-request.yml`

**Triggers:** When PR is opened, reopened, or marked ready for review

**What it does:**
- Automatically posts comment mentioning `@codex` and `@gemini-code-assist`
- Requests comprehensive review (quality, security, testing, documentation)
- References review policy from this document

**No configuration needed** - works out of the box!

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (Tests & Coverage)

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci-tests-coverage.yml`

**Triggers:** On all PRs and pushes to master

**What it does:**
- Spins up Redis and Postgres test services
- Runs full test suite with pytest
- Checks test coverage (fails if < 80%)
- Runs linting (mypy, ruff)
- Posts coverage report as PR comment
- Uploads coverage HTML report as artifact

**Configuration:**
- Minimum coverage threshold: 80% (configurable in workflow)
- Coverage report posted to PRs automatically
- Integrates with Codecov (optional)

**Example workflow output:**
```
‚úÖ Tests: 74 passed
‚úÖ Coverage: 87%
‚úÖ Linting: Passed
```

### 3. Gemini Code Assist Integration

**Configuration files:**
- `.gemini/config.yaml` - Review settings and focus areas
- `GEMINI.md` - Project-specific context and standards

**What it does:**
- Automatically reviews all new PRs within 5 minutes
- Posts inline comments on code issues
- Generates PR summaries
- Severity filtering (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

**Focus areas:**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Logic errors and bugs
- Performance issues
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation completeness
- Best practices violations

**Customization:**

Edit `.gemini/config.yaml` to adjust:
```yaml
code_review:
  comment_severity_threshold: MEDIUM  # Change to HIGH to reduce noise
  inline_suggestions: true
  severity_filters:
    critical: true
    high: true
    medium: true
    low: false  # Disable low-priority nitpicks
```

### 4. Codex via MCP (MANDATORY Pre-Commit Review)

**Purpose:** Integrate OpenAI Codex directly into Claude Code for code review and test generation

**Setup:** See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/codex-mcp-integration.md`

**What it provides:**
- Code review using GPT-5 or O3 models
- Automatic test generation
- Coverage gap analysis
- Bug fixing assistance
- Direct integration with Claude Code (no separate CLI needed)

**Quick start:**
```bash
# Install Codex CLI
npm install -g @openai/codex

# Authenticate
codex exec "echo test"  # Follow prompts

# Test MCP server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector codex mcp-server

# Register with Claude Code
claude mcp add --transport stdio codex-mcp -- codex mcp-server

# Restart Claude Code
# Then invoke codex from Claude Code
```

**Usage in Claude Code:**
- "Use codex to review libs/risk_management/breaker.py"
- "Ask codex to generate tests for this file"
- "Use codex to analyze coverage gaps"

**See full guide:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/codex-mcp-integration.md`

## Summary: Complete Automation Workflow

### For Developers

**Minimal setup:**
```bash
# 1. Install and authenticate GitHub CLI
brew install gh
gh auth login

# 2. Tell Claude to create PRs
"Implement ticket T4 and create a PR when done"
```

**What happens automatically:**

1. **During PR creation:**
   - Claude creates feature branch
   - Commits with progressive commits throughout development
   - Runs tests locally
   - Pushes to remote
   - Creates PR with detailed description
   - **GitHub Actions automatically requests reviews from @codex and @gemini-code-assist** ‚ú®

2. **After PR is created:**
   - CI/CD pipeline runs tests and coverage checks
   - Gemini Code Assist reviews code within 5 minutes
   - @codex and @gemini-code-assist post review comments
   - Coverage report posted to PR
   - Test results visible in GitHub UI

3. **After you fix review issues:**
   - Push fixes to same branch
   - CI/CD pipeline re-runs automatically
   - **Manually request re-review:** `gh pr comment <PR> --body "Fixed the issues you identified. @codex @gemini-code-assist please review the latest changes on this branch."`
   - Wait for approval from all reviewers
   - Merge when all checks pass ‚úÖ

### For AI Assistants (Claude Code)

**Your automated workflow:**

1. **During implementation:**
   - Make progressive commits every 30-60 minutes
   - Push regularly to backup work
   - Run tests locally before pushing

2. **When creating PR:**
   - Create PR with comprehensive description
   - Include checklist from TESTING.md
   - Reference ADRs and implementation guides
   - **No need to manually request reviews** - automated by GitHub Actions! ‚ú®

3. **After receiving reviews:**
   - Address ALL HIGH and MEDIUM priority issues
   - Create test cases for reported bugs
   - Push fixes to same branch
   - **Manually comment to request re-review:**
     ```bash
     gh pr comment <PR> --body "Fixed issues X, Y, Z.

     @codex @gemini-code-assist please review latest commit."
     ```
   - Wait for explicit approval from reviewers
   - Only merge when all reviewers approve

### Benefits

**For developers:**
- ‚úÖ Never forget to request automated reviews
- ‚úÖ Consistent review quality across all PRs
- ‚úÖ Faster feedback (reviews within 5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Multiple AI perspectives (Codex + Gemini)
- ‚úÖ Test coverage automatically tracked

**For AI assistants:**
- ‚úÖ Reduced cognitive load (one less step to remember)
- ‚úÖ Consistent workflow across all PRs
- ‚úÖ Clear expectations for review policy
- ‚úÖ Automated initial review request

**For the project:**
- ‚úÖ Higher code quality (caught by AI before human review)
- ‚úÖ Better security (automated security scanning)
- ‚úÖ Improved test coverage (coverage gates enforced)
- ‚úÖ Faster iteration (early feedback)
- ‚úÖ Educational value (AI reviewers explain issues)

### You Retain Control

Despite automation, you remain in control:
- Review PR before merging (human approval still required)
- Can bypass specific review comments with justification
- Can adjust automation settings (`.gemini/config.yaml`)
- Can disable workflows if needed
- Merge only when satisfied with quality

**This workflow keeps you in the driver's seat while automating the tedious parts.**
