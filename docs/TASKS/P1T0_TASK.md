# P1T0: Enhanced P&L Calculation

**Phase:** P1 (Hardening & Automation, 46-90 days)
**Status:** TASK (Not Started)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Owner:** @development-team
**Created:** 2025-10-20
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days

---

## Naming Convention

**This task:** `P1T0_TASK.md` → `P1T0_PROGRESS.md` → `P1T0_DONE.md`

**If this task has multiple features/sub-components:**
- Feature 0: `P1T0-F0_PROGRESS.md` (separate tracking for complex features)
- Feature 1: `P1T0-F1_PROGRESS.md`

**Where:**
- **Px** = Phase (P1 = MVP/0-45 days, P1 = Hardening/46-90 days, P2 = Advanced/91-120 days)
- **Ty** = Task number within phase (T0, T1, T2, ...)
- **Fz** = Feature/sub-component within task (F0, F1, F2, ...)

---

## Objective

Replace notional P&L with comprehensive realized/unrealized breakdown for accurate performance tracking.

**Current State (P0):**
- `paper_run.py` calculates total notional value only
- Validates order sizing but doesn't track actual profit/loss
- No distinction between realized (closed) and unrealized (open) positions

**Success looks like:**
- Complete P&L calculation with realized/unrealized breakdown
- Fee tracking and tax implications calculated
- JSON export with detailed P&L components
- Tests verify P&L accuracy across scenarios

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** Calculate realized P&L from closed positions
- [ ] **AC2:** Calculate unrealized P&L (mark-to-market) on open positions
- [ ] **AC3:** Track fee breakdown (commission + other fees)
- [ ] **AC4:** JSON export includes complete P&L structure
- [ ] **AC5:** Unit tests cover multi-day, partial fills, buy-sell sequences
- [ ] **AC6:** Integration test validates P&L against known scenarios

---

## Approach

### High-Level Plan

1. **Define P&L data structure** - Create Pydantic models for P&L components
2. **Implement calculation logic** - Add functions for realized/unrealized P&L
3. **Update paper_run.py** - Replace notional with complete P&L calculation
4. **Update JSON export** - Include full P&L structure in output
5. **Add comprehensive tests** - Cover all P&L scenarios
6. **Update documentation** - Add examples and formulas
7. **Verify with historical data** - Validate against known scenarios

### Logical Components

**Component 1: P&L Data Models**
- Create Pydantic models for realized/unrealized/total P&L
- Define fee breakdown structure
- Add tests for model validation
- Request zen-mcp review & commit

**Component 2: Realized P&L Calculation**
- Implement FIFO-based cost basis tracking
- Calculate realized gains on position closes
- Track fees per transaction
- Add unit tests for buy-sell sequences
- Request zen-mcp review & commit

**Component 3: Unrealized P&L Calculation**
- Implement mark-to-market for open positions
- Handle partial fills correctly
- Add unit tests for open positions
- Request zen-mcp review & commit

**Component 4: Integration & Export**
- Update paper_run.py to use new P&L system
- Export complete P&L to JSON
- Add integration tests
- Request zen-mcp review & commit

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify/Create
- `libs/common/pnl_models.py` - NEW: Pydantic models for P&L structure
- `libs/common/pnl_calculator.py` - NEW: Realized/unrealized P&L calculation logic
- `scripts/paper_run.py` - MODIFY: Replace notional P&L with complete calculation
- `tests/unit/test_pnl_calculator.py` - NEW: Unit tests for P&L logic
- `tests/integration/test_paper_run_pnl.py` - NEW: End-to-end P&L validation

### APIs/Contracts
- No API changes (internal calculation only)
- JSON export structure will change (backward compatible field addition)

### Database Changes
- No database changes required (P&L calculated on-demand from position data)

---

## Dependencies

**Blockers (must complete before starting):**
- P0T4: Execution Gateway - Provides position tracking data required for P&L calculation

**Nice-to-have (can start without):**
- None

**Blocks (other tasks waiting on this):**
- None (standalone enhancement)
