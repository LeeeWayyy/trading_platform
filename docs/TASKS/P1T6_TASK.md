# P1T6: Advanced Trading Strategies

**Phase:** P1 (Hardening & Automation, 46-90 days)
**Status:** TASK (Not Started)
**Priority:** MEDIUM (Optional - can defer to P2)
**Owner:** @development-team
**Created:** 2025-10-20
**Estimated Effort:** 7-10 days

---

## Naming Convention

**This task:** `P1T6_TASK.md` → `P1T6_PROGRESS.md` → `P1T6_DONE.md`

**If this task has multiple features/sub-components:**
- Feature 0: `P1T6-F0_PROGRESS.md` (separate tracking for complex features)
- Feature 1: `P1T6-F1_PROGRESS.md`

**Where:**
- **Px** = Phase (P1 = MVP/0-45 days, P1 = Hardening/46-90 days, P2 = Advanced/91-120 days)
- **Ty** = Task number within phase (T6, T1, T2, ...)
- **Fz** = Feature/sub-component within task (F0, F1, F2, ...)

## Objective

Implement additional ML strategies beyond Alpha158 baseline for diversification and improved risk-adjusted returns.

**Current State (P0):**
- Single baseline strategy (Alpha158 + LightGBM)
- No strategy diversification
- No ensemble methodology

**Success looks like:**
- Mean reversion strategy implemented and backtested
- Momentum strategy implemented and backtested
- Multi-model ensemble framework combining strategies
- Strategy comparison framework with performance metrics
- Documented strategy selection methodology

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** Mean reversion strategy achieves positive Sharpe ratio in backtests
- [ ] **AC2:** Momentum strategy achieves positive Sharpe ratio in backtests
- [ ] **AC3:** Multi-model ensemble framework combines strategy signals
- [ ] **AC4:** Backtesting framework validates all strategies with consistent data
- [ ] **AC5:** Strategy performance comparison report generated
- [ ] **AC6:** Unit tests cover strategy logic and ensemble weighting

## Approach

### High-Level Plan

1. **Research strategies** - Review mean reversion and momentum methodologies
2. **Implement mean reversion** - Features, model, backtests
3. **Implement momentum** - Features, model, backtests
4. **Build ensemble framework** - Strategy combination and weighting
5. **Add backtesting framework** - Consistent validation across strategies
6. **Performance comparison** - Generate strategy comparison reports
7. **Integration** - Integrate with signal service

### Logical Components

**Component 1: Mean Reversion Strategy**
- Implement mean reversion features (price oscillators, bollinger bands)
- Train LightGBM model with mean reversion signals
- Add unit tests for feature calculation
- Backtest on historical data (2020-2024)
- Request zen-mcp review & commit

**Component 2: Momentum Strategy**
- Implement momentum features (price momentum, volume trends)
- Train LightGBM model with momentum signals
- Add unit tests for feature calculation
- Backtest on historical data (2020-2024)
- Request zen-mcp review & commit

**Component 3: Multi-Model Ensemble**
- Implement strategy weighting framework
- Combine signals from multiple strategies
- Add configuration for strategy weights
- Add unit tests for ensemble logic
- Request zen-mcp review & commit

**Component 4: Backtesting Framework**
- Create consistent backtesting pipeline
- Generate strategy performance metrics (Sharpe, IC, returns)
- Create comparison visualization
- Add integration tests
- Request zen-mcp review & commit

## Dependencies

**Blockers (must complete before starting):**
- P0T2: Baseline Strategy - Provides model registry and training infrastructure

**Nice-to-have (can start without):**
- P1T1: Redis Integration - Would enable strategy signal caching

**Blocks (other tasks waiting on this):**
- None (optional enhancement)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Strategies perform poorly in live conditions | High | Medium | Extensive backtesting on 4+ years of data, walk-forward validation |
| Overfitting to historical data | High | Medium | Cross-validation, out-of-sample testing, regular model retraining |
| Ensemble weights not optimal | Medium | Medium | Configurable weights, A/B testing framework, performance monitoring |
| Integration complexity with signal service | Medium | Low | Gradual rollout, feature flags, extensive integration testing |

- [ ] Concept doc in `/docs/CONCEPTS/` if trading-specific
- [ ] API spec in `/docs/API/` if endpoint changes

## Notes

**Priority Note:** This task is **OPTIONAL** and can be deferred to P2 if needed. Focus on T0 (Enhanced P&L) and production hardening tasks (T9, T10) first.

**Strategy Selection Rationale:**
- Mean reversion: Captures market inefficiencies and oversold/overbought conditions
- Momentum: Trend-following for sustained directional moves
- Ensemble: Diversification reduces strategy-specific risk

**Reference:** See [ADR-0003](../ADRs/0003-baseline-strategy-with-qlib-and-mlflow.md) for baseline strategy architecture that this extends.
