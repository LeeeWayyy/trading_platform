# P1T6: Advanced Trading Strategies

**Phase:** P1 (Hardening & Automation, 46-90 days)
**Status:** TASK (Not Started)
**Priority:** MEDIUM (Optional - can defer to P2)
**Owner:** @development-team
**Created:** 2025-10-20
**Estimated Effort:** 7-10 days

## Naming Convention

**This task:** `P1T6_TASK.md` â†’ `P1T6_PROGRESS.md` â†’ `P1T6_DONE.md`

**If this task has multiple features/sub-components:**
- Feature 0: `P1T6-F0_PROGRESS.md` (separate tracking for complex features)
- Feature 1: `P1T6-F1_PROGRESS.md`

**Where:**
- **Px** = Phase (P1 = MVP/0-45 days, P1 = Hardening/46-90 days, P2 = Advanced/91-120 days)
- **Ty** = Task number within phase (T6, T1, T2, ...)
- **Fz** = Feature/sub-component within task (F0, F1, F2, ...)
