## P2 Tasks Breakdown

### Track 1: Trading Infrastructure

#### T0: TWAP Order Slicer ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Goal:** Split large parent orders into smaller child slices for better execution

**Current State (P1):**
- Execution gateway submits single orders
- No support for slicing large orders
- Risk of market impact on large positions

**P2 Requirements:**
```python
# apps/execution_gateway/order_slicer.py
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class TWAPSlicer:
    """Time-Weighted Average Price order slicer"""

    def __init__(self, parent_order, n_slices: int = 6, horizon_minutes: int = 60):
        self.parent_id = parent_order.id
        self.symbol = parent_order.symbol
        self.side = parent_order.side
        self.total_qty = parent_order.qty
        self.n_slices = n_slices
        self.horizon = timedelta(minutes=horizon_minutes)

    def plan(self, start_time: datetime) -> list[dict]:
        """
        Generate slice schedule with proper remainder handling

        Validates inputs and ensures minimum lot size (1 share) respected.
        If total_qty < n_slices, reduces number of slices to avoid 0-qty slices.
        """
        if self.n_slices <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Number of slices must be positive")
        if self.total_qty <= 0:
            return []  # No quantity to allocate

        # Adjust number of slices to avoid creating slices with zero quantity
        # Ensures minimum lot size of 1 share per slice
        num_slices = min(self.total_qty, self.n_slices)

        base_qty = int(self.total_qty / num_slices)
        remainder = self.total_qty - (base_qty * num_slices)
        interval = self.horizon / num_slices

        schedule = []
        allocated = 0
        for i in range(num_slices):
            # Distribute remainder across first slices to ensure total_qty is allocated
            slice_qty = base_qty + (1 if i < remainder else 0)
            allocated += slice_qty

            schedule.append({
                'parent_id': self.parent_id,
                'slice_num': i,
                'qty': slice_qty,
                'scheduled_time': start_time + (interval * i),
                'symbol': self.symbol,
                'side': self.side
            })

        # Verify total allocation equals parent quantity
        assert allocated == self.total_qty, f"Allocation mismatch: {allocated} != {self.total_qty}"
        return schedule
```

**DDL for Parent/Child Tracking (extends existing orders table):**
```sql
-- Extend existing orders table with parent/child relationship fields
-- NOTE: Reuses existing lifecycle columns (status, submitted_at, filled_at, etc.)

ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN parent_order_id TEXT REFERENCES orders(client_order_id);
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN slice_num INTEGER;  -- NULL for parent orders, 0-N for children
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN total_slices INTEGER;  -- Total child count for parent orders
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN scheduled_time TIMESTAMPTZ;  -- For TWAP scheduling

-- Index for parent-child lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_parent_id ON orders(parent_order_id) WHERE parent_order_id IS NOT NULL;

-- View for easy parent order tracking
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW parent_order_status AS
SELECT
  parent.client_order_id as parent_id,
  parent.symbol,
  parent.side,
  parent.qty as total_qty,
  parent.total_slices,
  COUNT(child.client_order_id) as slices_submitted,
  SUM(CASE WHEN child.status = 'filled' THEN child.filled_qty ELSE 0 END) as filled_qty,
  CASE
    WHEN COUNT(child.client_order_id) < parent.total_slices THEN 'pending'
    WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN child.status IN ('filled', 'canceled') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = parent.total_slices THEN 'complete'
    ELSE 'active'
  END as aggregated_status
FROM orders parent
LEFT JOIN orders child ON child.parent_order_id = parent.client_order_id
WHERE parent.parent_order_id IS NULL  -- Only parent orders
GROUP BY parent.client_order_id, parent.symbol, parent.side, parent.qty, parent.total_slices;
```

**Implementation Steps:**

2. **Extend existing orders table** with parent/child relationship columns (no new tables)
3. **Implement slice scheduler** with time-based execution
4. **Integrate with circuit breaker/kill switch**: Check breaker state before each slice submission
5. **Track fill progress** and update parent order status
6. **Handle partial fills** and slice failures
7. **Add tests** for slicing logic, fill tracking, error cases, circuit breaker integration
8. **Update execution gateway** to support sliced orders

**Dependencies:** P0T4 (Execution Gateway), database, existing circuit breaker/kill switch
**Files to Create:**
- `apps/execution_gateway/order_slicer.py`
- `apps/execution_gateway/slice_scheduler.py` (NEW: handles time-based execution)
- `tests/apps/execution_gateway/test_order_slicer.py`
- `tests/apps/execution_gateway/test_slice_scheduler.py` (NEW)
- `docs/ADRs/ADR-XXX-twap-order-slicing.md`

**Files to Modify:**
- `apps/execution_gateway/main.py` (add slicing endpoints + scheduler integration)
- `db/migrations/XXXX_extend_orders_for_slicing.sql` (extends existing orders table)

---

#### T1: Multi-Alpha Allocator ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Goal:** Allocate capital across multiple strategies with risk-aware blending

**Current State (P1):**
- Multiple strategies implemented (baseline, momentum, mean reversion, ensemble)
- Each strategy produces independent signals
- No automated capital allocation across strategies

**P2 Requirements:**
```python
# libs/allocation/multi_alpha.py
import polars as pl
from typing import Literal

AllocMethod = Literal['rank_aggregation', 'inverse_vol', 'equal_weight']

class MultiAlphaAllocator:
    """Allocate capital across multiple alpha strategies"""

    def __init__(
        self,
        method: AllocMethod = 'rank_aggregation',
        per_strategy_max: float = 0.40,  # Max 40% to any strategy
        correlation_threshold: float = 0.70  # Alert if corr > 70%
    ):
        self.method = method
        self.per_strategy_max = per_strategy_max
        self.correlation_threshold = correlation_threshold

    def allocate(
        self,
        signals: dict[str, pl.DataFrame],  # strategy_id -> signals (symbol, score, weight)
        strategy_stats: dict[str, dict]     # strategy_id -> {vol, sharpe, ...}
    ) -> pl.DataFrame:
        """
        Allocate capital weights across strategies

        Integration with orchestrator:
        1. Orchestrator collects Signal objects from each strategy
        2. Converts Signal.target_weights (dict) to pl.DataFrame per strategy
        3. Passes dict[strategy_id, pl.DataFrame] to allocator
        4. Allocator returns blended pl.DataFrame with columns: [symbol, final_weight, contributing_strategies]
        5. Orchestrator converts back to single aggregated Signal for execution
        """
        if self.method == 'rank_aggregation':
            return self._rank_aggregation(signals)
        elif self.method == 'inverse_vol':
            return self._inverse_vol(signals, strategy_stats)
        elif self.method == 'equal_weight':
            return self._equal_weight(signals)

    def check_correlation(
        self,
        recent_returns: dict[str, pl.DataFrame]
    ) -> dict[str, float]:
        """Check inter-strategy correlation and alert if too high"""
        pass
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Create MultiAlphaAllocator class** with 3 methods (rank aggregation, inverse-vol, equal-weight)
2. **Implement rank aggregation**: Average normalized ranks across strategies
3. **Implement inverse volatility**: Weight inversely to recent realized vol
4. **Implement correlation monitoring**: Alert when strategies too correlated
5. **Add per-strategy caps**: Enforce maximum allocation per strategy
6. **Create tests**: Unit tests for each method, integration tests for full allocation
7. **Update orchestrator integration**: Add Signal→DataFrame conversion helpers and allocator invocation
8. **Add documentation**: Allocation methodology, parameter tuning, and orchestrator integration pattern

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Rank aggregation implemented correctly
- [ ] Inverse volatility weighting implemented
- [ ] Equal weight baseline implemented
- [ ] Per-strategy max enforced (40% default)
- [ ] Correlation monitoring alerts when correlation >70% (logged as WARNING + emitted to Redis pub/sub 'alerts' channel with metric name='strategy_correlation')
- [ ] Total allocated weight sums to 100% (or configured total)
- [ ] Tests cover all three methods
- [ ] Performance: Allocation <500ms for 10 strategies, 100 symbols (measured via pytest-benchmark in integration tests)
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] ADR documenting allocation methodology created

**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days
**Dependencies:** P1T6 (Advanced Strategies), P1T7 (Risk Management)
**Files to Create:**
- `libs/allocation/multi_alpha.py`
- `tests/libs/allocation/test_multi_alpha.py`
- `docs/ADRs/ADR-XXX-multi-alpha-allocation.md`

**Files to Modify:**
- `apps/orchestrator/orchestrator.py` (integrate allocator)

### Track 2: Production Readiness

#### T2: Secrets Management ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Goal:** Secure API keys and credentials before live trading

**Current State (P1):**
- Credentials stored in `.env` file
- API keys committed to repository (in `.gitignore` but risky)
- No key rotation mechanism

**P2 Requirements:**
```python
# libs/secrets/manager.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class SecretManager(ABC):
    """Abstract secret manager interface"""

    @abstractmethod
    def get_secret(self, name: str) -> str:
        """Retrieve secret by name"""
        pass

class VaultSecretManager(SecretManager):
    """HashiCorp Vault implementation"""

    def __init__(self, vault_addr: str, token: str):
        self.vault_addr = vault_addr
        self.token = token

    def get_secret(self, name: str) -> str:
        # Use hvac library to fetch from Vault
        pass

class AWSSecretsManager(SecretManager):
    """AWS Secrets Manager implementation"""

    def __init__(self, region: str):
        self.region = region

    def get_secret(self, name: str) -> str:
        # Use boto3 to fetch from AWS Secrets Manager
        pass
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. Choose secrets backend (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Doppler)
2. Migrate credentials from `.env` to chosen backend
3. Update services to fetch secrets on startup
4. Add secret rotation mechanism (90-day rotation)
5. Remove `.env` from codebase (except template)
6. Add audit logging for secret access

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Create SecretManager interface** with pluggable backends
2. **Implement Vault backend** (recommended for self-hosted)
3. **Implement AWS Secrets Manager backend** (if using AWS)
4. **Create dual-mode config pattern**: Secrets via SecretManager, non-secret config via Pydantic Settings (env vars)
5. **Update all services** to separate secrets (API keys, tokens) from config (ports, timeouts, feature flags)
6. **Add secret rotation script** for API keys
7. **Create migration guide** from `.env` to secrets backend with config separation
8. **Maintain `.env.template`** for local dev with placeholder secrets + real config
9. **Add tests** for secret retrieval, fallback handling, and dual-mode operation
10. **Update documentation** with security best practices and config vs secrets pattern

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] SecretManager interface defined
- [ ] Vault backend implemented and tested
- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager backend implemented (optional)
- [ ] All services fetch secrets from manager (no more .env)
- [ ] Secret rotation script functional
- [ ] Audit logging for secret access
- [ ] `.env.template` provided (no actual secrets)
- [ ] Migration guide documented
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] ADR documenting secrets architecture created

**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days
- Backend provisioning (Vault/AWS setup): 1-2 days
- Implementation + migration: 2-3 days
- Service wiring + testing: 1-2 days
- CI regression testing + documentation: 1 day

**Dependencies:** Infrastructure (Vault or AWS account), CI pipeline access
**Files to Create:**
- `libs/secrets/manager.py`
- `libs/secrets/vault_backend.py`
- `libs/secrets/aws_backend.py`
- `tests/libs/secrets/test_secret_manager.py`
- `docs/ADRs/ADR-XXX-secrets-management.md`
- `docs/RUNBOOKS/secret-rotation.md`

**Files to Modify:**
- All `apps/*/main.py` (use SecretManager)
- `.gitignore` (remove .env, add .env.template)

#### T3: Web Console 🔶 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Goal:** Build minimal web UI for manual intervention and monitoring

**Current State (P1):**
- CLI commands for operations (`make status`, etc.)
- No graphical interface
- No manual order entry capability

**P2 Requirements:**

**Tech Choice:** Streamlit (fast to build) or Next.js + FastAPI backend (more control)

**Features:**
1. **Dashboard**: Live positions, P&L, strategy status
2. **Manual Order Entry**: Submit orders with confirmation (audit logged)
3. **Strategy Controls**: Enable/disable strategies per symbol
4. **Emergency Kill Switch**: Cancel all orders, flatten positions, block new signals
5. **Audit Log Viewer**: View all manual actions with timestamps

**Streamlit Implementation (MVP):**
```python
# apps/web_console/app.py
import streamlit as st
import requests

st.set_page_config(page_title="Trading Platform Console", layout="wide")

# Cache data fetching to prevent blocking I/O on every UI interaction
@st.cache_data(ttl=10)  # Cache for 10 seconds
def fetch_positions():
    """Fetch positions from execution gateway with error handling"""
    try:
        response = requests.get("http://localhost:8002/api/v1/positions", timeout=5)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        st.error(f"Failed to fetch positions: {e}")
        return []

# Dashboard tab
with st.expander("📊 Dashboard", expanded=True):
    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)

    with col1:
        st.metric("Total P&L", "$1,234.56", "+5.2%")
    with col2:
        st.metric("Open Positions", "12")
    with col3:
        st.metric("Strategies Active", "3/4")

    # Positions table from execution gateway (port 8002)
    # Using cached function to prevent blocking on every UI interaction
    positions = fetch_positions()
    if positions:
        st.dataframe(positions)
    else:
        st.warning("No positions data available")

# Manual Order Entry tab
with st.expander("📝 Manual Order Entry"):
    symbol = st.text_input("Symbol")
    side = st.selectbox("Side", ["buy", "sell"])
    qty = st.number_input("Quantity", min_value=1)

    if st.button("Submit Order"):
        with st.form("confirm_order"):
            st.warning(f"Confirm: {side.upper()} {qty} shares of {symbol}?")
            reason = st.text_input("Reason (required for audit)")
            if st.form_submit_button("Confirm"):
                # Submit with audit log
                pass

# Kill Switch tab
with st.expander("🚨 Emergency Kill Switch", expanded=False):
    st.error("WARNING: This will cancel all orders and flatten all positions")
    reason = st.text_area("Reason (required)")
    if st.button("ACTIVATE KILL SWITCH", type="primary"):
        if not reason:
            st.error("Reason required for audit")
        else:
            # Activate kill switch with audit
            pass
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Choose tech stack** (Streamlit for MVP)
2. **Create dashboard** with positions, P&L, strategy status
3. **Add manual order entry** with confirmation dialog
4. **Implement strategy controls** (enable/disable toggles)
5. **Build kill switch** with confirmation and audit logging
6. **Add audit log viewer** with filtering
7. **Add authentication** (basic auth for MVP)
8. **Add tests** for backend endpoints
9. **Deploy as Docker container**
10. **Add documentation** with screenshots

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dashboard shows live positions and P&L
- [ ] Manual order entry works with confirmation

#### T4: Tax & Compliance Tracking ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Goal:** Track tax lots and generate compliance reports

**Current State (P1):**
- Orders and fills tracked
- No tax lot accounting
- No wash sale detection
- No compliance reporting

**P2 Requirements:**
```python

## P2 Roadmap & Priorities

### Phase Breakdown

**Priority Order:**
1. **T0: TWAP Slicer** (7-9 days) - Better execution for large orders
2. **T1: Multi-Alpha Allocator** (5-7 days) - Capital allocation across strategies
3. **T2: Secrets Management** (5-7 days) - Security requirement for live
4. **T4: Tax & Compliance** (7-10 days) - Regulatory requirement
5. **T3: Web Console** (7-10 days) - Operational convenience (can be parallel)
6. **T5: Live Rollout** (3-5 days prep + 30 days execution) - Final graduation

**Parallel Tracks:**
- Track 1 (T0, T1): Can run sequentially or parallel
- Track 2 (T2, T4): Should complete before T5
- Track 3 (T3): Can run in parallel with Track 1
- Track 4 (T5): Starts only after all others complete

---

## Total P2 Effort Estimates

**IMPORTANT:** These estimates assume P1 is 100% complete. If P1 tasks remain, add their effort before calculating P2 timeline.

### Minimum Viable P2
- **Time:** 24-33 days (preparation only, no web console)
- **Focus:** T0, T1, T2, T4 only (7-9 + 5-7 + 5-7 + 7-10 = 24-33 days)
- **Breakdown:** TWAP 7-9 + Allocator 5-7 + Secrets 5-7 + Tax 7-10 days
- **Output:** Live-trading capable system without UI

### Recommended P2
- **Time:** 34-48 days (preparation) + 30 days (rollout)
- **Focus:** All 6 tasks (full phase scope with updated estimates)
- **Output:** Complete live trading system with operational UI and graduated rollout

**Breakdown (Recommended):**
- T0 TWAP: 7-9 days
- T1 Allocator: 5-7 days
- T2 Secrets: 5-7 days
- T3 Web Console: 7-10 days
- T4 Tax: 7-10 days
- T5 Rollout Prep: 3-5 days
- **Subtotal:** 34-48 days prep
- Rollout Execution: 30 days (phases 1-4)
- **Total:** 34-48 days prep + 30 days rollout = 64-78 days end-to-end

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: P1 Completion Gate

**MANDATORY: ALL remaining P1 tasks MUST be 100% complete and verified before commencing ANY P2 work.**

**Required P1 Deliverables:**
- [ ] **P1T0: Enhanced P&L Calculation** - REQUIRED for live trading performance assessment
- [ ] **P1T9: Centralized Logging** - REQUIRED for debugging operational issues during rollout
- [ ] **P1T10: CI/CD Pipeline** - REQUIRED for safe deployment automation
- [ ] **P1T12: Walk-forward Automation** - REQUIRED for strategy validation

**Rationale:**
Going live without these foundations creates unacceptable operational risk:
- Missing P&L tracking = Cannot assess profitability accurately
- Missing centralized logging = Cannot debug production issues efficiently
- Missing CI/CD = Manual deployment errors during critical rollout phases
- Missing walk-forward = Unvalidated strategy parameters in live trading

**Gate Process:**
1. Verify all 4 P1 tasks marked as DONE in `/docs/TASKS/P1_PLANNING.md`
2. Run full regression test suite: `make test && make lint`
3. Verify all P1 acceptance criteria met
4. Obtain stakeholder sign-off on P1 completion
5. ONLY THEN proceed with P2T0 (TWAP Slicer)

---

### Infrastructure
- [ ] HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager account
- [ ] Brokerage account with live API access
- [ ] Sufficient capital for graduated rollout ($100-$50k+)
- [ ] Docker for web console deployment

### External Services
- [ ] Alpaca live API credentials
- [ ] PagerDuty account (optional, for alerts)
- [ ] SSL certificates for web console (if public)

### Skills/Knowledge
- [ ] TWAP algorithm and smart order routing
- [ ] Portfolio allocation theory (rank aggregation, inverse-vol)
- [ ] Tax lot accounting (FIFO, LIFO, wash sales)
- [ ] Web development (Streamlit or Next.js)
- [ ] Secrets management best practices
- [ ] **Operational readiness and incident response training** (kill switch activation, manual overrides, log analysis, disaster recovery)

---

## Risk & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Market Impact from Large Orders
**Impact:** High (slippage costs reduce profitability)
**Probability:** Medium (depends on order sizes)
**Mitigation:**
- TWAP slicer spreads orders over time (T0)
- Benchmark slippage against backtests
- Start with small position sizes in rollout
- Monitor realized vs assumed slippage

### Risk 2: Incorrect Tax Accounting
**Impact:** High (tax penalties, audit risk)
**Probability:** Low (if tested thoroughly)
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive tests for FIFO, LIFO, wash sales
- Validate against broker tax reports
- Consult with CPA before live trading
- Use conservative accounting (FIFO default)

### Risk 3: Security Breach of API Keys
**Impact:** Critical (account takeover, financial loss)
**Probability:** Low (with proper secrets management)
**Mitigation:**
- Secrets backend with encryption (T2)
- 90-day key rotation policy
- Audit logging for all secret access
- 2FA on brokerage account
- Read-only credentials for dashboards

### Risk 4: Live Trading Losses
**Impact:** High (real money at risk)
**Probability:** Medium (strategies may not perform)
**Mitigation:**
- Graduated rollout starts with $100-$500 (T5)
- Circuit breakers limit daily losses (P1T7)
- Kill switch for emergency stops (T3)
- Extensive paper trading validation (2+ weeks)
- Real-time monitoring and alerts (P1T8)

### Risk 5: Operational Errors
**Impact:** Medium (manual mistakes)
**Probability:** Low (with proper tools and training)
**Mitigation:**
- Web console with confirmation dialogs (T3)
- Audit logging for all manual actions
- Runbooks for common scenarios
- Team training before live trading
- Disaster recovery playbook tested

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase Start)
1. [x] ~~Review P1 progress~~ → **CRITICAL: Complete ALL remaining P1 tasks FIRST (P1T0, P1T9, P1T10, P1T12)**
2. [ ] **DO NOT START P2** until P1 completion gate verified (see Dependencies section)
3. [ ] Finalize P2 plan (this document) - obtain stakeholder approval
4. [ ] After P1 complete: Generate task files: `./scripts/tasks.py generate-tasks-from-phase P2`
5. [ ] After P1 complete: Begin first task: `./scripts/tasks.py start P2T0`

### This Week
- [ ] Design TWAP algorithm
- [ ] Research multi-alpha allocation methods

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

**From P1 (Remaining):**
1. **Enhanced P&L Calculation** (P1T0)
   - Status: Deferred to P1
   - Impact: Using notional P&L only
   - Plan: Complete before live trading

2. **Centralized Logging** (P1T9)
   - Status: Deferred to P1
   - Impact: Logs scattered across services
   - Plan: Complete before live trading (debugging requirement)

3. **CI/CD Pipeline** (P1T10)
   - Status: Deferred to P1
   - Impact: Manual deployments
   - Plan: Complete before scaling operations

**New Debt (Acceptable for P2):**
- VWAP slicing deferred (TWAP only for P2)
- Mean-variance allocator deferred (rank/inverse-vol only for P2)
- Advanced web console features deferred (basic MVP for P2)
