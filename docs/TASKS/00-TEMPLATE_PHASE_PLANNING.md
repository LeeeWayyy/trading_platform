## Executive Summary

[Brief overview of what this phase aims to accomplish]

**Key P0 Goals:**
1. [Goal 1]
2. [Goal 2]
3. [Goal 3]

**Development Workflow:**

All tasks in this phase follow the standard development workflow with **clink-based zen-mcp reviews**:

1. **Task Creation Review** (RECOMMENDED for complex tasks >4 hours)
   - Use workflow: `.claude/workflows/13-task-creation-review.md`
   - Tool: clink + gemini planner ‚Üí codex planner
   - Validates: scope clarity, requirements completeness, safety requirements
   - Duration: ~2-3 minutes

2. **Progressive Implementation** (MANDATORY 4-step pattern per component)
   - Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Quick Review ‚Üí Commit
   - Quick review tool: clink + codex codereviewer
   - See: `.claude/workflows/03-zen-review-quick.md`
   - Frequency: Every 30-60 minutes per component

3. **Deep Review** (MANDATORY before PR)
   - Use workflow: `.claude/workflows/04-zen-review-deep.md`
   - Tool: clink + gemini codereviewer ‚Üí codex codereviewer
   - Reviews: architecture, safety, scalability, test coverage
   - Duration: ~3-5 minutes

**Review Cost Model:**
- Subscription-based: $320-370/month (predictable, unlimited reviews)
- See `/docs/CONCEPTS/zen-mcp-clink-optimization-proposal.md` for details
