# P2T2: Multi-Source Failover System ðŸ”¶ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Phase:** P2 (MVP Core, 0-45 days)
**Status:** TASK (Not Started)
**Priority:** P2 (MVP)
**Owner:** @development-team
**Created:** 2025-10-26
**Estimated Effort:** X days

## Naming Convention

**This task:** `P2T1_DONE.md` â†’ `P2T2_PROGRESS.md` â†’ `P2T2_DONE.md`

**If this task has multiple features/sub-components:**
- Feature 0: `P2T2-F0_PROGRESS.md` (separate tracking for complex features)
- Feature 1: `P2T2-F1_PROGRESS.md`

**Where:**
- **Px** = Phase (P2 = MVP/0-45 days, P1 = Hardening/46-90 days, P2 = Advanced/91-120 days)
- **Ty** = Task number within phase (T2, T1, T2, ...)
- **Fz** = Feature/sub-component within task (F0, F1, F2, ...)

## Task Creation Review Checklist

**RECOMMENDED:** Before starting work, request task creation review to validate scope and requirements.

See [`.claude/workflows/13-task-creation-review.md`](../../.claude/workflows/13-task-creation-review.md) for workflow details.

**Review validates:**
- [ ] Objective is clear and measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are testable
- [ ] Functional requirements are comprehensive
- [ ] Trading safety requirements specified (circuit breakers, idempotency, position limits)
- [ ] Non-functional requirements documented (performance, security)
- [ ] Component breakdown follows 4-step pattern
- [ ] Time estimates are reasonable
- [ ] Dependencies and blockers identified
- [ ] ADR requirement clear for architectural changes
- [ ] Test strategy comprehensive

**When to use task review:**
- âœ… Complex tasks (>4 hours estimated)
- âœ… Tasks with architectural changes
- âœ… Tasks with unclear requirements
- âœ… New feature development

**Can skip for:**
- Trivial tasks (<2 hours, well-defined)
- Simple bug fixes
- Documentation-only updates

**How to request:**
```bash
# Phase 1: Gemini validation
"Review docs/TASKS/[this_file].md using clink + gemini planner"

# Phase 2: Codex synthesis
"Use clink + codex planner with continuation_id to synthesize readiness assessment"
```
