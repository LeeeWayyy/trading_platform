## Objective

Simplify and optimize the entire documentation and workflow system to improve AI discoverability, reduce context usage, and strengthen quality gates.

## Problem Statement

**Current Issues:**

1. **Scattered Documentation:**
   - Markdown files scattered across multiple directories (`docs/`, `.claude/workflows/`, `docs/ADRs/`, `docs/STANDARDS/`, etc.)
   - No single unified index → hard to track all documentation
   - AI must search multiple locations to build complete picture
   - "We have md file everywhere and it makes things really hard to track"

2. **Complex Workflows:**
   - Workflows are verbose and consume too much context
   - Not optimized for AI comprehension
   - Repetitive content across multiple workflow files
   - Not minimized → wastes token budget

3. **Weak Review Gates:**
   - Commit review only uses one reviewer (codex)
   - Should use both codex AND gemini for better coverage
   - No automated enforcement (relies on discipline)
   - Missing opportunities for comprehensive validation

---

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Unified Document Index (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Replace/merge existing `docs/INDEX.md` with comprehensive unified index for ALL documentation.

**Decision: Enhance Existing docs/INDEX.md (Not Create New File)**

After reviewer feedback, we will **enhance the existing `docs/INDEX.md`** rather than create a separate `UNIFIED_INDEX.md`:

**Rationale:**
- Avoids duplication and potential conflicts
- Preserves existing bookmarks and references
- Simpler maintenance (one file, not two)
- Existing INDEX.md already serves this role (just needs expansion)

**Approach:**

Enhance existing `docs/INDEX.md` to include:
- All `docs/` files (STANDARDS, CONCEPTS, ADRs, TASKS, RUNBOOKS, GETTING_STARTED)
- **NEW:** All `.claude/workflows/` files (currently missing)
- **NEW:** All implementation guides
- **NEW:** CLAUDE.md, root README.md
- **NEW:** Automated completeness validation

**Enhanced Index Format:**
```markdown
# Documentation Index

## Quick Navigation by Task Type
[Task-oriented navigation patterns]

## All Documentation (Alphabetical)
[Complete A-Z catalog with metadata]

## Documentation by Location
### docs/STANDARDS/
- [STATUS, DATE, TYPE] Filename - Description
### docs/CONCEPTS/
- [STATUS, DATE, TYPE] Filename - Description
### .claude/workflows/ (NEW)
- [STATUS, DATE, TYPE] Filename - Description
[etc.]

## Documentation by Type
### Standards (MUST follow)
[All standard docs regardless of location]
### Workflows (Process guidance - NEW)
[All workflow docs from .claude/workflows/]
### Concepts (Domain knowledge)
[All concept docs]
[etc.]

## Maintenance & Automation
- Last updated: [date]
- Validation script: scripts/validate_doc_index.sh
- Update frequency: On every doc add/remove
```

**Automation Plan (Addresses Codex Concern #1):**

Create `scripts/validate_doc_index.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Validates docs/INDEX.md is complete and up-to-date

# Find all markdown files (expanded scope to include project root)
ALL_MDS=$( { find docs .claude/workflows -name "*.md" -type f; \
             find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -type f; } | sort -u )

# Extract indexed files from INDEX.md
INDEXED=$(grep -E '\[.*\]\(.*\.md\)' docs/INDEX.md | sed -E 's/.*\((.*\.md)\).*/\1/' | sort)

# Compare
MISSING=$(comm -23 <(echo "$ALL_MDS") <(echo "$INDEXED"))

if [ -n "$MISSING" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Following files not indexed in docs/INDEX.md:"
    echo "$MISSING"
    exit 1
else
    echo "✓ All markdown files are indexed"
    exit 0
fi
```

**Integration:**
- Add to CI: `make validate-docs` target
- Run in pre-commit hook (optional)
- Owner: Development team lead (quarterly manual review)
- **Scope:** All markdown files (docs/, .claude/workflows/, project root: README.md, CLAUDE.md)

**Benefits:**
- Single entry point for AI to discover ALL docs
- No duplication with existing INDEX.md
- Automated validation prevents drift
- Complete inventory always visible

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced `docs/INDEX.md` (includes .claude/workflows/, CLAUDE.md, README.md)
- Created `scripts/validate_doc_index.sh` (automated validation)
- Added `make validate-docs` target
- Metadata for all entries (status, date, type)
- Multiple navigation paths (by task, by location, by type)
- Update policy documented

---

### 2. Workflow Simplification (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Reduce workflow verbosity while maintaining precision. Optimize for AI comprehension and minimal context usage.

**Current State Analysis:**
- `.claude/workflows/` contains 15+ workflow files
- Many workflows repeat similar information
- Verbose examples and long explanations
- Not optimized for token efficiency

**Baseline Metrics (Addresses Codex Concern #2):**

Before starting, collect baseline:
```bash
# Measure current state
wc -l .claude/workflows/*.md > /tmp/workflow_baseline.txt
# Total lines: ~6000 (estimated)
# Average per file: ~400 lines

# Token estimate (rough): 6000 lines × 3 tokens/line = ~18,000 tokens
```

**Target Metrics:**
- Reduce total lines by 60%: 6000 → 2400 lines
- Reduce average file size: 400 → 150 lines
- Token reduction: 18,000 → 7,200 tokens (60% savings)
- **Acceptance threshold:** ≥50% reduction with no loss of essential information

**Simplification Strategy:**

**A. Consolidate Common Patterns (1 hour)**

Create `.claude/workflows/CORE_PATTERNS.md` (~200 lines):
```markdown
# Core Development Patterns

## 4-Step Component Pattern (MANDATORY)
1. Implement logic
2. Create tests (TDD)
3. Review (clink + codex + gemini) + CI (`make ci-local`)
4. Commit (after approval + CI pass)

## Review Tiers
- Tier 1 (Quick): clink + codex + gemini (~90s, pre-commit)
- Tier 2 (Deep): clink + gemini + codex (~3-5min, pre-PR)
- Tier 3 (Task): clink + gemini planner (~2-3min, pre-work)

## Pre-Implementation Analysis Checklist
[Minimal, essential checklist - 10 key points]

## Common Review Commands
[Standardized clink examples - 5 patterns]

## Common Anti-Patterns
[Top 10 violations to avoid]
```

**B. Minimize Individual Workflows (1 hour)**

Refactor each workflow file to:
- Remove redundant explanations (reference CORE_PATTERNS.md instead)
- Use concise step lists (no verbose examples unless unique to workflow)
- Eliminate repetition across files
- Focus on workflow-specific deviations only
- Keep ONLY essential decision trees and edge cases

**Target:** Reduce average workflow file from 400+ lines to ~150 lines

**C. Create Workflow Quick Reference (30 min)**

Update `.claude/workflows/README.md` (~100 lines):
```markdown
# Workflow Quick Reference

## Common Patterns (Read First)
See [CORE_PATTERNS.md](./CORE_PATTERNS.md) for:
- 4-step component cycle
- Review tier system
- Standard clink commands
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## By Development Phase
- **Pre-work:** 13-task-creation-review.md, 00-analysis-checklist.md
- **During work:** 01-git-commit.md (every 30-60 min)
- **Before PR:** 04-zen-review-deep.md, 02-git-pr.md
- **Issues:** 06-debugging.md, 10-ci-triage.md

## Individual Workflows
[Minimal 1-line descriptions, link to full docs]
```

**AI Comprehension Testing (Addresses Gemini Concern #1):**

**Validation Method:**
1. Create test task: "Implement simple feature X following workflows"
2. Have AI agent execute task using ONLY simplified workflows
3. Success criteria:
   - AI completes task without clarification requests
   - AI follows 4-step pattern correctly
   - AI uses correct review tier
   - AI doesn't miss mandatory steps
4. If test fails, identify missing guidance and restore to workflows

**Measurement:**
```bash
# After refactoring
wc -l .claude/workflows/*.md > /tmp/workflow_after.txt
# Compare: diff /tmp/workflow_baseline.txt /tmp/workflow_after.txt

# Token count validation
# Verify ≥50% reduction achieved
```

**Deliverables:**
- `.claude/workflows/CORE_PATTERNS.md` created (consolidates common patterns)
- All workflow files refactored (remove redundancy, reduce verbosity)
- `.claude/workflows/README.md` updated (quick reference guide)
- Average workflow file reduced to ~150 lines (from 400+)
- Token usage reduced by ≥50% (measured and validated)
- AI comprehension test passed

---

### 3. Dual-Reviewer Commit Process (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Strengthen quality gates by using both codex AND gemini for commit reviews.

**Current Problem:**
- Quick review (`.claude/workflows/03-zen-review-quick.md`) only uses codex
- Single reviewer may miss issues
- Gemini provides different perspective (architecture, long-term maintainability)
- Codex focuses on code quality, safety, idempotency

**Pilot Plan (Addresses Codex Concern #3):**

**Phase 1: Pilot on Limited Scope (1 week)**

**Scope:**
- Apply dual-review ONLY to feature/P1T13-* branches initially
- Measure throughput impact via automated metrics
- Document edge cases and escalation needs

**Metrics Collection (AI Coder Context):**
- **Method:** Automated metrics logging during pilot period
- **Metrics to Track:**
  - Time per commit: baseline (30s single-reviewer) → with dual-review (measured)
  - Commits per day: before vs after
  - Issues caught by gemini that codex missed (log continuation_id outcomes)
  - Issues caught by codex that gemini missed (log continuation_id outcomes)
  - False positive rate (issues flagged but not actual problems)
  - Review consistency (do both reviewers agree on severity?)
- **Data Collection:**
  - Log each review request with timestamps
  - Track continuation_id chains to analyze issue resolution
  - Document specific examples of value-add from each reviewer
- **Analysis:**
  - Compare metrics at end of Week 1
  - Review logged examples of complementary issue detection
  - Assess whether dual-review adds sufficient value for time cost

**Success Criteria for Pilot:**
- <2 min average commit review time
- ≥30% more issues caught vs single-reviewer
- No developer complaints about blocking

**Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (If Pilot Succeeds)**

1. Week 2: Apply to all feature/* branches
2. Week 3: Apply to all branches
3. Week 4: Update workflows and CLAUDE.md to mandate

**Proposed Implementation: Sequential Dual-Review Process**

Update `.claude/workflows/03-zen-review-quick.md`:

```markdown
## Quick Review Process (MANDATORY Before Every Commit)

**Step 1: Codex Safety Review (~30 seconds)**
```bash
# Use clink with codex codereviewer
# Focus: Trading safety, idempotency, test coverage, error handling
```

**Step 2: Gemini Architecture Review (~60 seconds)**
```bash
# Use clink with gemini codereviewer (reuse continuation_id from codex)
# Focus: Pattern consistency, long-term maintainability, architectural concerns
```

**Step 3: Address ALL Findings**
- Fix issues from BOTH reviews
- Re-request verification if changes made
- Only commit when BOTH reviewers approve

**Emergency Override:**
- If gemini unavailable: Codex-only acceptable with note in commit message
- If codex unavailable: Block commit (trading safety critical)
- Document override reason: "REVIEW_OVERRIDE: [reason]"
```

**Time Impact:** +60 seconds per commit (30s codex + 60s gemini)
**Benefit:** Dual perspectives catch more issues before commit (estimated 30% improvement)

**Integration with Existing Infrastructure (Addresses Gemini Concern #3):**

**Check existing pre-commit hook:**
```bash
# Review scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
# Determine if dual-review can integrate or should replace
```

**Options:**
1. **Chain with existing:** Existing hook → Dual-review → Commit
2. **Replace existing:** New dual-review hook includes existing checks
3. **Parallel:** Keep existing, add dual-review as separate step

**Future Automation (Option B - Not in Scope):**

Design pre-commit hook for future implementation:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit (FUTURE WORK)

# 1. Run existing checks (tests, lint)
source scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh || exit 1

# 2. Run codex review
CODEX_RESULT=$(claude_code_api clink codex codereviewer)
[ "$CODEX_RESULT" == "approved" ] || exit 1

# 3. Run gemini review
GEMINI_RESULT=$(claude_code_api clink gemini codereviewer)
[ "$GEMINI_RESULT" == "approved" ] || {
    echo "Override: git commit --no-verify"
    exit 1
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- `.claude/workflows/03-zen-review-quick.md` updated with dual-review process
- Pilot plan documented and executed (1 week)
- Throughput metrics collected and analyzed
- Emergency override procedure documented
- Integration plan with existing pre-commit hooks
- `CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect dual-reviewer requirement (after pilot)
- All commit workflow references updated (after pilot)
