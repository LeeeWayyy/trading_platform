- `docs/CONCEPTS/websocket-streaming.md` - WebSocket patterns (607 lines)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/p1.2t1-realtime-market-data-phase3.md` - Phase 3 guide (540 lines)

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Latency**: < 60ms from market event to P&L calculation
- **Throughput**: 10K+ messages/second capacity
- **Reconnection**: Exponential backoff (5s ‚Üí 10s ‚Üí 20s ‚Üí 40s)
- **Cache TTL**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Sync Interval**: 5 minutes (auto-subscription)

**Test Results:**
- Unit tests: 15/15 passing (position_sync.py)
- Integration tests: 10/10 passing (realtime_pnl.py)
- Coverage: 88% (position_sync), 95% (realtime_pnl)

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Three-Tier Fallback**: Real-time ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Entry Price for 100% uptime
2. **Redis as Cache**: O(1) lookups, < 1ms latency, decouples services
3. **Auto-Subscription**: Position-based (no manual subscribe/unsubscribe)
4. **Exponential Backoff**: Reconnection with increasing delays
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Services work even if WebSocket/Redis down

**Key Learnings:**
1. WebSocket reconnection must use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming server
2. Position model in schemas.py != database model (API vs persistence layers)
3. Always use virtual environment (updated AI_GUIDE.md with reminder)
4. Three-tier fallback provides reliability without complexity
5. Auto-subscription eliminates manual subscription errors

   - `CircuitBreakerTripped` - Breaker active
   - `PositionLimitExceeded` - Position too large
   - `NotionalLimitExceeded` - Total exposure too high

**Test Coverage:**
- `test_breaker.py` - 542 lines, 52 tests, 88% coverage
- `test_checker.py` - 463 lines, 38 tests, 100% coverage
