### ✅ P1.1T2 - Redis Integration

**Completed:** October 18, 2024
**PR:** [#10 - T1.2 Redis Integration](https://github.com/LeeeWayyy/trading_platform/pull/10)
**Effort:** 4 days

**What Was Delivered:**
- Redis client library with connection pooling
- Feature cache with Cache-Aside pattern
- Per-symbol caching with 1-hour TTL
- Event publisher for inter-service communication
- Graceful degradation (service works when Redis down)
- Health endpoint with Redis status monitoring

**Key Files:**
- `libs/redis_client/client.py` - RedisClient with connection pool (320 lines)
- `libs/redis_client/feature_cache.py` - FeatureCache implementation (270 lines)
- `libs/redis_client/events.py` - Pydantic event schemas (240 lines)
- `libs/redis_client/event_publisher.py` - Event publishing (180 lines)
- `tests/redis_client/` - Test suite (1,200+ lines, 75 tests)
- `apps/signal_service/signal_generator.py` - Feature caching integration
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/p1.1t2-redis-integration.md` - Implementation guide (850 lines)
- `docs/ADRs/0009-redis-integration.md` - Architecture decision (872 lines)
- `docs/CONCEPTS/redis-patterns.md` - Redis patterns guide (650 lines)

**Performance Improvements:**
- Cache hit: < 5ms (vs 100ms feature generation) - **20x faster**
- Cache miss + write: < 110ms (100ms generation + 10ms cache)
- Graceful degradation: Zero downtime on Redis failures

**Metrics:**
- Tests: 85/85 passing (100%)
  - Unit tests: 75/75 (Redis client, cache, events, publisher)
  - Integration tests: 10/10 (Signal Service + Redis)
- Lines of code: ~800 (production) + 1,200 (tests)
- Documentation: 2,595 lines (implementation guide + ADR + concepts)

**Key Learnings:**
1. Export all exceptions from library `__init__.py` for clean imports
2. Cache both primary and fallback data to maintain consistency
3. Make mocks realistic - use `side_effect` for dynamic behavior
4. Ensure consistent ordering when combining cached + generated data
5. Implement graceful degradation everywhere

### ✅ P1.2T1 - Real-Time Market Data Streaming

**Completed:** October 19, 2024
**PR:** TBD (feature/p1.2t1-realtime-market-data branch)
**Effort:** 7 days

**What Was Delivered:**
- WebSocket streaming of real-time market data from Alpaca
- Market Data Service (port 8004) with auto-reconnection
- Redis price caching + pub/sub event distribution
- Real-time P&L endpoint in Execution Gateway
- Position-based auto-subscription (syncs every 5 minutes)
- Three-tier price fallback (real-time → database → entry price)
- Comprehensive test coverage (25 tests, 88-95% coverage)
- Operational status script integration

**Key Files:**
- `libs/market_data/alpaca_stream.py` - WebSocket client (273 lines)
- `libs/market_data/types.py` - Pydantic models for quotes (101 lines)
- `libs/market_data/exceptions.py` - Custom exceptions
- `apps/market_data_service/main.py` - FastAPI service (336 lines)
- `apps/market_data_service/position_sync.py` - Auto-subscription (235 lines)
- `apps/execution_gateway/main.py` - Real-time P&L endpoint (+150 lines)
- `apps/execution_gateway/schemas.py` - Real-time P&L models (+35 lines)
- `scripts/operational_status.sh` - Real-time P&L display (+59 lines)
- Tests: 25 tests across 2 test files (1,000+ lines)

**Documentation:**
- `docs/ADRs/0010-realtime-market-data.md` - Architecture decision (500+ lines)
- `docs/CONCEPTS/websocket-streaming.md` - WebSocket patterns (607 lines)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/p1.2t1-realtime-market-data-phase3.md` - Phase 3 guide (540 lines)

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Latency**: < 60ms from market event to P&L calculation
- **Throughput**: 10K+ messages/second capacity
- **Reconnection**: Exponential backoff (5s → 10s → 20s → 40s)
- **Cache TTL**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Sync Interval**: 5 minutes (auto-subscription)

**Test Results:**
- Unit tests: 15/15 passing (position_sync.py)
- Integration tests: 10/10 passing (realtime_pnl.py)
- Coverage: 88% (position_sync), 95% (realtime_pnl)

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Three-Tier Fallback**: Real-time → Database → Entry Price for 100% uptime
2. **Redis as Cache**: O(1) lookups, < 1ms latency, decouples services
3. **Auto-Subscription**: Position-based (no manual subscribe/unsubscribe)
4. **Exponential Backoff**: Reconnection with increasing delays
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Services work even if WebSocket/Redis down

**Key Learnings:**
1. WebSocket reconnection must use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming server
2. Position model in schemas.py != database model (API vs persistence layers)
3. Always use virtual environment (updated AI_GUIDE.md with reminder)
4. Three-tier fallback provides reliability without complexity
5. Auto-subscription eliminates manual subscription errors
