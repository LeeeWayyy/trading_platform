- Graceful degradation: Zero downtime on Redis failures

**Metrics:**
- Tests: 85/85 passing (100%)
  - Unit tests: 75/75 (Redis client, cache, events, publisher)
  - Integration tests: 10/10 (Signal Service + Redis)
- Lines of code: ~800 (production) + 1,200 (tests)
- Documentation: 2,595 lines (implementation guide + ADR + concepts)

**Key Learnings:**
1. Export all exceptions from library `__init__.py` for clean imports
2. Cache both primary and fallback data to maintain consistency
3. Make mocks realistic - use `side_effect` for dynamic behavior
4. Ensure consistent ordering when combining cached + generated data
5. Implement graceful degradation everywhere
