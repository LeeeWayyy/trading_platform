# Documentation Index

**Canonical Entry Point for AI Coding Assistants and Developers**

This index provides a structured guide to all documentation, organized by purpose and priority. For AI assistants: **start here** to understand which documents are normative (must-follow) versus informational (context).

---

## üéØ Quick Start for AI Assistants

**When starting a new task, read in this order:**

1. **[STANDARDS/](./STANDARDS/)** - Normative guidance (MUST follow)
2. **[TASKS/](./TASKS/)** - Current work items
3. **[IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/)** - How-to references
4. **[ADRs/](./ADRs/)** - Architecture decisions
5. **[CONCEPTS/](./CONCEPTS/)** - Domain knowledge
