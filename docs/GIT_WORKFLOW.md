# Git Workflow & Pull Request Automation

## Overview

This document explains how to work with Git and automate pull request creation when using Claude Code or other AI assistants.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install GitHub CLI

```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux
# See https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md

# Windows
# See https://github.com/cli/cli#windows
```

### 2. Authenticate GitHub CLI

```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Select:
# - GitHub.com
# - HTTPS
# - Login with a web browser (recommended)
# - Follow the prompts

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

### 3. Configure Git

```bash
# Set your identity (if not already done)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Recommended: Set default branch name
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Recommended: Enable commit signing (optional but good practice)
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

## Automated PR Workflow with Claude Code

### Workflow Overview

When you ask Claude Code to implement a feature, it can automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Create a feature branch
2. ‚úÖ Make code changes
3. ‚úÖ Write tests
4. ‚úÖ Run tests and linting
5. ‚úÖ Commit changes with descriptive messages
6. ‚úÖ Push to remote repository
7. ‚úÖ Create pull request with detailed description
8. ‚úÖ Link related ADRs and documentation

### How to Enable Automatic PR Creation

**Option 1: Explicit Request (Recommended for Learning)**
```
User: "Implement idempotent order submission (ticket T4),
       then create a PR when done"
```

**Option 2: Default Behavior (Configure in Prompts)**

Add to your `prompts/assistant_rules.md`:
```markdown
## Automatic Pull Request Creation

After successfully implementing and testing any feature:
1. Create a feature branch (if not already on one)
2. Commit all changes with descriptive messages
3. Push to remote repository
4. Create a pull request using `gh pr create`
5. Include in PR description:
   - Summary of changes
   - Related ADR references
   - Testing completed
   - Checklist from /docs/TESTING.md
```

**Option 3: Use a Slash Command**

Create `.claude/commands/implement-and-pr.md`:
```markdown
You are implementing a ticket and creating a PR afterwards.

Workflow:
1. Ask user which ticket to implement
2. Read ticket from /docs/TASKS/
3. Follow implementation process from CLAUDE.md
4. After validation phase passes:
   a. Create feature branch if not exists
   b. Commit all changes
   c. Push to remote
   d. Create PR with gh pr create
5. Return PR URL to user
```

Then use: `/implement-and-pr`

## PR Creation Template

When Claude creates a PR, it should use this structure:

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of what was implemented (1-2 sentences).

## Related Work
- Ticket: #T4 (or link to /docs/TASKS/P0_TICKETS.md#t4)
- ADR: ADR-0004 (if applicable)

## Example Commands Claude Will Use

### Creating a Feature Branch
```bash
# Claude will run:
git checkout -b feature/t4-idempotent-orders
```

### Committing Changes
```bash
# If ADR exists, commit it first
git add docs/ADRs/0004-idempotent-order-submission.md
git commit -m "ADR-0004: Use deterministic client_order_id for idempotency"

# Then commit implementation
git add apps/execution_gateway/
git add tests/
git commit -m "Implement idempotent order submission (ADR-0004)

- Add deterministic_id() function using SHA256
- Update place_order() to check for duplicates
- Handle Alpaca 409 conflicts
- Add comprehensive tests

Closes #T4"
```

### Pushing and Creating PR
```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin feature/t4-idempotent-orders

# Create PR with gh CLI
gh pr create \
  --title "Implement idempotent order submission (T4)" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Implements idempotent order submission using deterministic client_order_id generation.

## Related Work
- Ticket: T4 (/docs/TASKS/P0_TICKETS.md)
- ADR: ADR-0004

## Changes Made
...
EOF
)"
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

Use consistent branch naming:

```bash
feature/t4-idempotent-orders     # New features
fix/circuit-breaker-recovery     # Bug fixes
docs/update-testing-guide        # Documentation only
refactor/extract-risk-checks     # Refactoring
chore/upgrade-dependencies       # Maintenance
```

## Controlling PR Creation

### When You Want Automatic PRs

Tell Claude:
```
"Implement ticket T4 and create a PR when tests pass"
```

### When You Want Manual Control

Tell Claude:
```
"Implement ticket T4 but don't create a PR yet -
 I want to review the changes first"
```

Then later:
```
"Create a PR for the changes we just made"
```

## PR Creation Safety Checks

Before Claude creates a PR, it should verify:

1. ‚úÖ All tests pass (`make test`)
2. ‚úÖ All linting passes (`make lint`)
3. ‚úÖ On a feature branch (not main/master)
4. ‚úÖ Changes are committed
5. ‚úÖ ADR created if needed
6. ‚úÖ Documentation updated

Claude will **not** automatically:
- ‚ùå Push to main/master directly
- ‚ùå Force push (unless explicitly requested and justified)
- ‚ùå Merge PRs (requires human review)
- ‚ùå Delete branches
- ‚ùå Modify git history with rebase/amend (unless explicitly requested)

## Working with Draft PRs

For work-in-progress, create draft PRs:

```bash
gh pr create --draft \
  --title "[WIP] Implement idempotent orders (T4)" \
  --body "Work in progress. Do not merge yet.

## TODO
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Get ADR reviewed
"
```

Then convert to ready when done:
```bash
gh pr ready
```

## Updating Existing PRs

Claude can update PRs by adding commits:

```bash
# Make additional changes
git add apps/execution_gateway/
git commit -m "Address review feedback: improve error messages"
git push

# Add comment to PR
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "Updated to address review feedback"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. One Feature Per PR
Keep PRs focused:
- ‚úÖ Single ticket implementation
- ‚úÖ Related tests and docs
- ‚ùå Multiple unrelated changes
- ‚ùå Mixing features and refactoring

### 2. Meaningful Commit Messages
```bash
# GOOD
"Implement deterministic order ID generation (ADR-0004)

- Add SHA256-based hash function
- Include order params and date in hash
- Truncate to 24 chars for Alpaca compatibility
- Add unit tests for collision resistance"

# BAD
"Fixed stuff"
"WIP"
"Updates"
```

### 3. Keep PRs Small
Aim for:
- < 500 lines of code changes
- < 10 files changed
- Single focused change

Large changes should be split into multiple PRs:
```
PR #1: Add deterministic ID generation (ADR-0004)
PR #2: Integrate ID generation into order submission
PR #3: Add duplicate detection logic
PR #4: Add integration tests
```

### 4. Link Everything
In PR description, link to:
- Ticket in /docs/TASKS/
- ADR in /docs/ADRs/
- Implementation guide
- Related concept docs
- Related PRs (if any)

### 5. Use PR Templates (Optional)

Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
```markdown
## Summary
<!-- Brief description of changes -->

## Related Work
- Ticket:
- ADR:
- Implementation Guide:

## Changes Made
- [ ]

## Testing Completed
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing in DRY_RUN mode

## Documentation Updated
- [ ] Concept docs
- [ ] Implementation guide
- [ ] ADR (if architectural change)
- [ ] Code has docstrings
- [ ] OpenAPI spec (if API changed)

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] OpenAPI updated (if API changed)
- [ ] Migrations included (if DB changed)
- [ ] Docs updated

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `gh` command not found
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh  # macOS
# or follow instructions at https://cli.github.com/
```

### Issue: Authentication failed
```bash
# Re-authenticate
gh auth login

# Check status
gh auth status
```

### Issue: Permission denied
```bash
# Check remote URL uses HTTPS (not SSH if not configured)
git remote -v

# Update to HTTPS if needed
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### Issue: Branch protection rules
If main/master has branch protection:
- PRs are required (good!)
- Claude cannot push directly (good!)
- You'll need to review and merge via GitHub UI

### Issue: PR created on wrong branch
```bash
# Close the PR
gh pr close <PR_NUMBER>

# Create correct branch
git checkout -b correct-branch-name

# Cherry-pick commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Push and create new PR
git push -u origin correct-branch-name
gh pr create
```

## Advanced: CI Integration

If you have GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install poetry
      - run: poetry install
      - run: poetry run pytest
      - run: poetry run mypy .
      - run: poetry run ruff check .
```

This will automatically run tests on every PR Claude creates.

## Summary: Enabling Automatic PRs

**Minimal setup:**
```bash
# 1. Install and authenticate
brew install gh
gh auth login

# 2. Tell Claude to create PRs
"Implement ticket T4 and create a PR when done"
```

**That's it!** Claude will handle:
- Branch creation
- Commits
- Testing
- Pushing
- PR creation with detailed description

You retain control:
- Review the PR before merging
- Request changes via GitHub UI
- Close/modify as needed
- Merge when satisfied

This workflow keeps you in the driver's seat while automating the tedious parts.
